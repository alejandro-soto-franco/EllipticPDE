# `C¹` coefficients and the coefficient difference-quotient bound

The interior `H²` estimate (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1;
Gilbarg–Trudinger, *Elliptic Partial Differential Equations of Second Order*, Thm 8.8)
needs the manuscript hypothesis `aᵢⱼ ∈ C¹` only through one quantitative consequence: the
difference quotient of each coefficient entry is uniformly bounded by the sup of its
gradient. This file bundles that hypothesis as an added structure `IsC1Coeff` (a mixin on
top of `EllipticCoeff`, leaving every existing consumer of `EllipticCoeff` untouched) and
proves the coefficient difference-quotient bound `abs_diffQuot_coeff_le` by the segment
mean-value inequality.

/-- A `C¹` ellipticity bundle: the coefficient matrix is continuously differentiable with a
global bound `A₁` on the first derivatives of every entry. Faithful to `aᵢⱼ ∈ C¹` for the
interior estimate, where only `a ∈ C¹(W̄)` with `W ⋐ Ω` bounded matters, so `A₁ < ∞`. -/
structure IsC1Coeff (A : EllipticCoeff d) where
  /-- Every coefficient entry is continuously differentiable. -/
  contDiff : ∀ i j, ContDiff ℝ 1 (fun x => A.a x i j)
  /-- The uniform bound on the first derivatives of every entry. -/
  A1 : ℝ
  /-- `A1` is nonnegative. -/
  A1_nonneg : 0 ≤ A1
  /-- The Fréchet derivative of every coefficient entry is bounded by `A1` at every point. -/
  grad_bdd : ∀ i j, ∀ x, ‖fderiv ℝ (fun y => A.a y i j) x‖ ≤ A1

/-- The coefficient difference quotient is uniformly bounded: for the `(i, j)` coefficient
entry, `|Dₖʰ aᵢⱼ(x)| ≤ A₁` for every `x` and every `h ≠ 0`. This is the pointwise
commutator bound used in the master interior estimate to control the coefficient-
difference-quotient term `∑ ∫ (Dₖʰ aᵢⱼ) ∂ᵢu · ∂ⱼ(ζ² Dₖʰ u)` (Evans, *Partial Differential
Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1). -/
