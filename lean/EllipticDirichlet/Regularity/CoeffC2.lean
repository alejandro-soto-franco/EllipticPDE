# `C²` coefficients

The differentiated-equation identity (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.),
§6.3.2, Theorem 4) needs one order of differentiability beyond the interior `H²` estimate:
the coefficient gradient `∂_ℓ aᵢⱼ` must itself be treated as a `C¹` weight. This file bundles
that hypothesis as `IsC2Coeff`, a mixin on top of `EllipticCoeff` one derivative order above
`IsC1Coeff` (a mechanical copy of `CoeffC1.lean`), leaving every existing consumer of
`EllipticCoeff` and `IsC1Coeff` untouched.
