# The master interior difference-quotient energy estimate

The interior second-derivative estimate (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.),
§6.3.1; Gilbarg-Trudinger, *Elliptic PDE of Second Order*, Theorem 8.8) proceeds by testing
the weak formulation of `L u = f` with the difference-quotient test element
`v_h = -Dₖ^{-h}(ξ² Dₖ^h u)`, using discrete integration by parts to move the outer difference
quotient onto the coefficient factor, uniform ellipticity from below to control the leading
term, and Cauchy-Schwarz together with the Peter-Paul (Young) inequality to absorb the
commutator, cross, zeroth-order, and right-hand terms.

## Main declarations

* `evansTest`: the admissible test element `v_h = -Dₖ^{-h}(ξ² Dₖ^h u) ∈ H₀¹(Ω)`, whose
  membership is two applications of `cutoffMul_diffQuotG_mem_H01`.

/-! ### D1: The admissible Evans test element -/

/-- **The admissible Evans test element** `v_h = -Dₖ^{-h}(ξ² Dₖ^h u) ∈ H₀¹(Ω)`. The inner
cutoff `ξ²` and the outer cutoff `θ` (which is `≡ 1` on `tsupport ξ`) localise the two
difference quotients so that the composite stays inside `H₀¹(Ω)`; membership is two
applications of the crux admissibility lemma `cutoffMul_diffQuotG_mem_H01`, together with
closure of the submodule under negation. This is the single admissible test vector that the
weak formulation consumes in the difference-quotient energy method (Evans, *Partial
Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1). -/

/-- **Support of the interior difference quotient.** If a class `g` has whole-space extension
a.e. supported in a measurable set `S`, then its interior difference quotient `diffQuotD k h g`
vanishes (a.e. on `Ω`) outside `S ∪ (S - h eₖ)`: the numerator
`extendL2 g (x + h eₖ) - g x` can be nonzero only when `x ∈ S` (through `g x`) or
`x + h eₖ ∈ S` (through the translate). -/

/-- **θ-chop invisibility.** If `g`'s extension is a.e. supported in `S` and the outer cutoff
`θ ≡ 1` on the part of `Ω` reachable into `S` by the shift, then multiplying `θ` onto the
interior difference quotient of `g` is invisible: `θ · Dₖʰ g = Dₖʰ g`. This is what lets the
outer cutoff of the Evans test element drop out of the energy identity (Evans, *Partial
Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1). -/

/-- **θ-cross-term vanishing.** Under the same support and `θ ≡ 1` conditions (so that
`∂ⱼθ = 0` on the reachable part of `Ω`), the partial-cutoff multiplier annihilates the
interior difference quotient: `(∂ⱼθ) · Dₖʰ g = 0`. This kills the outer-cutoff cross term of
the Evans test element, which would otherwise be a second-order (double difference-quotient)
object beyond the reach of the data bound (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.),
§6.3.1). -/

/-! ### D2 core: discrete integration by parts -/

/-- **Discrete integration by parts, principal term.** For a class `p` whose whole-space
extension stays supported inside `Ω` after the backward shift, the restricted-domain pairing
of the coefficient action against the backward interior difference quotient of `p` transfers,
via the extension isometry and the whole-space adjoint relation `diffQuot_inner_adjoint`,
into minus the whole-space pairing of the *forward* difference quotient of the coefficient
action against `extendL2 p`. This is the discrete analogue of moving the derivative off the
test factor onto the coefficient factor (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.),
§6.3.1, proof of Theorem 3). -/
