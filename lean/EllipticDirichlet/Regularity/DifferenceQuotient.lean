# Difference quotients on `L²(ℝⁿ)`

The difference quotient `Dₖʰ u(x) = (u(x + h eₖ) - u(x)) / h` is the engine of the
interior regularity theory (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §5.8.2
and §6.3.1). It is realised here as a continuous linear map on the whole-space space
`EucL2 d`, built from the translation isometry `transL2`, so that its adjoint and norm
bounds descend from translation invariance of Lebesgue measure.
