# Density extension to H₀¹ (dependency-chain step 4)

The Poincaré inequality, once established for every smooth compactly supported test
function, extends to all of `H₀¹(Ω)` by density. The key structural facts (proved in
`Sobolev/Basic.lean`) are that the test-function graphs already form a submodule
(`span_testGraphSet`) and that `H₀¹(Ω)` is their topological closure. The Poincaré
estimate is the condition `0 ≤ Φ` for a continuous function `Φ`, hence a closed
condition; holding on the dense test functions, it passes to the closure.

The base estimate on test functions is taken as a hypothesis here (it is supplied by the
domain Poincaré inequality `poincare_domain` rewritten through the `L²` norms). This keeps
the density mechanism independent of the geometry of `Ω`.

/-- **Density Poincaré inequality on `H₀¹`.** If the Poincaré bound
`‖φ‖²_{L²} ≤ C · ∑ᵢ ‖∂ᵢφ‖²_{L²}` holds for every test function `φ` (phrased through the
graph coordinates `testGraph 0` and `testGraph i.succ`), then it holds for every element
of `H₀¹(Ω)`: the function part `U 0` is controlled by the gradient part `U ∘ Fin.succ`. -/
