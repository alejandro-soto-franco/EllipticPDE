# Weak sequential compactness in a Hilbert space

A bounded sequence in a real Hilbert space has a subsequence along which every inner product
converges, to the inner product against one fixed vector. This is the sequential form of
Banach-Alaoglu on a reflexive space, and it is the compactness the direct method of the calculus
of variations runs on, where `EllipticPdes.Embedding.rellichEmbL_isCompact_of_lt` supplies the
strong compactness at the lower exponent.

Mathlib has Banach-Alaoglu as `WeakDual.isCompact_closedBall` and the weak topology as
`WeakSpace`, and stops short of the sequential statement, which needs the ball to be metrisable
and so the space to be separable. The proof here avoids separability of the whole space by
working inside the closed span of the sequence.

## Three steps

* the diagonal: `⟪u n, u m⟫` lies in a fixed compact box for each `m`, so the sequence of
  functions `m ↦ ⟪u n, u m⟫` lies in a compact subset of `ℕ → ℝ`, which is metrisable, and a
  subsequence converges pointwise;
* the extension: the vectors against which the inner products converge form a closed submodule,
  since the bound `M` makes the convergence uniform in the direction, and it contains the
  sequence, hence the closed span, hence everything by orthogonal decomposition;
* the limit: the resulting functional is linear and bounded by `M`, so Riesz representation names
  the weak limit.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Analysis.exists_weakLimit`: the weak sequential compactness statement.
