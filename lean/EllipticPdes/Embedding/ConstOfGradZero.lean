# Constancy of a class with zero weak gradient on a connected open set

Evans states this as Problem 11 of Chapter 5 and uses it in the proof of the Poincaré
inequality of §5.8.1, where the limit of the renormalised sequence has zero weak gradient and
must be constant to contradict its unit norm. Guo's Poincaré inequality is the `W_0^{1,p}`
form and does not need it.

The proof runs in three steps. On a ball whose double lies in the set, the mollifications of
the class have zero classical gradient, since the mollified weak gradient is the gradient of
the mollification, so each is constant on the ball, and an `L¹` limit of constants on a set of
positive finite measure is constant, the constants spanning a closed line in `L¹`. The constant
attached to each ball is locally constant in the centre, two overlapping balls sharing it on
their intersection, so on a preconnected set it is one constant. A countable subcover of the
set by such balls then puts the class equal to that constant almost everywhere.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.ae_const_of_tendsto_ae_const`: an `L¹` limit of almost-everywhere
  constant functions is almost-everywhere constant.
* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.ae_const_on_ball_of_hasWeakGradOn_zero`: the class is constant
  on every ball whose double lies in the set.
* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.ae_const_of_hasWeakGradOn_zero`: the class is constant on a
  preconnected open set.
