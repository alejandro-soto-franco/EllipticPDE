# Uniqueness of the weak gradient on an open set

Two weak gradients of one function differ by a function orthogonal to every test function, and
on an open set the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations kills it. Mathlib has the
lemma as `IsOpen.ae_eq_zero_of_integral_contDiff_smul_eq_zero`.

Uniqueness is what lets separate structures be assembled into one family. Higher interior
regularity is proved order by order, so a solution with derivatives of every order arrives as one
family per order, with nothing relating them; uniqueness identifies the entries they share, and
a single family closed under differentiation follows.

## Main declarations

/-- **Uniqueness of the weak gradient on an open set.** Two weak gradients of the same function
agree almost everywhere, given integrability on the set, which is what the fundamental lemma of
the calculus of variations asks of the difference.

Integrability rather than local integrability is asked for because the only sets this is applied
to are balls, where an `L²` class supplies it, and because the splitting of the test integral
needs it anyway. -/
