# The Sobolev ladder at the full step

`EllipticPdes.Embedding.exists_eLpNorm_sobolevConj_le` raises the exponent from `p` to `p'` with
`1/p' = 1/p - 1/d`. Iterating it `s` times lands on `1/p - s/d`, which is the exponent Guo's
Sobolev embedding writes as `p^{∗⋯∗}` (Guo, *Partial Differential Equations*, Theorem IV.2.3).
This file runs that iteration from `p = 2`, at the full step and to a bounded depth.

## The rung condition

A rung is available while the reciprocal below it stays positive, and `2 * s ≤ d` is what keeps
it so: at the top rung the reciprocal is `1/2 - s/d ≥ 0`, and at every rung below it exceeds
`1/d`. So `⌊d/2⌋` rungs run, against the `d - 1` a half-step ladder needs, and both reach `L^{2d}`.

The top rung is where the two dimensional parities separate. For `d` even the reciprocal at
`s = d/2` is exactly `0`, so the rung reaches every finite exponent and attains none of them;
for `d` odd it is `1/(2d)`, and that one is attained. Neither case is special in the proof,
since the statement asks only that the target reciprocal be at least `1/2 - s/d`, and
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.exists_eLpNorm_sobolevConj_le_of_le` is what lets a rung be fed from an
exponent above the one it consumes. That is the same mechanism
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.exists_eLpNorm_four_le` uses in dimension two.

## Bounded depth

The family is closed under differentiation only as far as `dep` records. An index `i` sits at
depth `dep i`, differentiating adds at most one, and `m` is the total supply. Running `s` rungs
on `F i` consumes `s` of the orders above `dep i`, so the conclusion is stated for those `i` with
`dep i + s ≤ m`. A family closed at every order is the case `dep = 0`.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.memLp_of_gradClosed_fullStep`: the ladder, at rung `s` and any exponent
  the rung reaches.
* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.memLp_two_mul_of_gradClosed_fullStep`: the ladder run to `L^{2d}`, which
  passes `d` in every dimension and is what `EllipticPdes.Embedding.morrey_ball` consumes.

/-! ### Ladder -/

/-- **The Sobolev ladder at the full step, to bounded depth.** Let `F` assign a function to each
index of `ι`, let `nxt i k` name a weak `k`-derivative of `F i` on `Metric.ball c R`, and let
`dep` record how far an index sits above the root, so that differentiating adds at most one. If
every index of depth at most `m` lies in `L²` there and every index of depth below `m` has its
weak gradient in the family, then at rung `s` with `2 * s ≤ d` every index of depth at most
`m - s` lies in `Lq` on `Metric.ball c r`, for any exponent `q ≥ 2` whose reciprocal is at least
`1/2 - s/d`.

The induction is on the rung. Each step splits the gap `r < R` at its midpoint, applies the
hypothesis at rung `s` on the outer half to the index and to its derivatives, and takes one
Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev step on the inner half. The depth bookkeeping is what replaces
closure at every order: a derivative sits one level higher, so a rung fewer is available to it,
and that is what the recursive call is given. -/

/-- **The full-step ladder, run to the top.** An index of depth at most `m - ⌊d/2⌋` in a family
closed under weak differentiation as far as `m`, with every member of depth at most `m` in `L²`
on `Metric.ball c R`, lies in `L^{2d}` on any smaller concentric ball. Since `2d > d`, this is
the exponent `EllipticPdes.Embedding.morrey_ball` asks for, in every dimension.

The rung count is `⌊d/2⌋`, and the reciprocal it lands on is `1/2 - ⌊d/2⌋/d`, which is `0` when
`d` is even and `1/(2d)` when `d` is odd. Both are at most `1/(2d)`, which is why one statement
serves the two parities. -/
