# Bridge from `HasWeakDerivOn` to `HasWeakGradOn`

The `L²` weak derivatives produced by `interior_H2_estimate` are pointwise weak
gradients in the sense of the embedding layer, so the Morrey inequality consumes them
directly at `p = 2`, hence in dimension one.

Higher dimensions need an `Lᵖ` bootstrap first, since Morrey asks for `p > d`. Dimensions two and
three are covered in `EllipticPdes.Embedding.GagliardoNirenberg`, where the
Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality raises the gradient from `L²` to `L⁶` at `d = 3` and, over
the finite measure of a ball, from `L^{4/3}` to `L⁴` at `d = 2`. The three resulting Hölder
estimates are `EllipticPdes.Embedding.interior_holder_estimate_one`,
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.interior_holder_estimate_two` and
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.interior_holder_estimate`.

Dimension four and above needs the step iterated, which costs a weak derivative per rung and so
asks for more than the `H²` estimate supplies. `EllipticPdes.Embedding.memLp_of_gradClosed` runs
that ladder on a family closed under differentiation.
