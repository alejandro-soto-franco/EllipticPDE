# Continuous weak gradient as a classical gradient

The Sobolev ladder puts a solution and its weak derivatives in a Hölder class, so both are
continuous. Continuity is what turns them back into classical derivatives: a function with a
continuous weak gradient on an open set is Fréchet differentiable there, with that gradient.

The argument is mollification. Each mollification is smooth, its classical partials are the
mollified weak gradient (`EllipticPdes.Embedding.partialD_convolution_eq_of_hasWeakGradOn`), and
a mollification of a continuous function converges to it uniformly on a ball whose enlargement by
the mollifier radius stays inside the region, since the function is uniformly continuous on the
enlargement. Mathlib's `hasFDerivAt_of_tendstoUniformlyOn` then passes the derivative to the
limit: derivatives converging uniformly and values converging pointwise identify the limit's
derivative.

Uniform convergence is where the hypotheses are spent. Pointwise convergence of the
mollifications alone would not do, since it says nothing about the derivatives, and the
convergence of the mollified gradient has to be uniform in the base point for the limit theorem
to see it.

/-! ### Uniform convergence of the mollifications -/

/-- **Mollifications of a continuous function converge uniformly on an interior ball.** The
enlargement `Metric.closedBall x (ρ + σ)` is compact and sits inside the region, so the function
is uniformly continuous there. Once the mollifier radius drops below the modulus of continuity,
the mollification at every point of `Metric.ball x ρ` averages values within `ε/2` of the value
at that point, and the estimate is uniform because the modulus is.

The extension by zero is what the convolution reads, and it is invisible: every point the
mollifier sees at radius at most `σ` lies in the enlargement, hence in the region. -/

/-! ### Classical derivative -/

/-- **Continuous weak gradient as a classical derivative.** On an open region, a function that
is continuous and integrable, with a weak gradient that is continuous and integrable, is Fréchet
differentiable at every point, with derivative the functional the gradient names.

The proof mollifies on a ball whose double closure sits inside the region. Each mollification is
smooth, its partials are the mollified gradient components, and both converge uniformly on the
ball. `hasFDerivAt_of_tendstoUniformlyOn` collects that into the derivative of the limit, and the
limit is the function itself, since a mollification of a continuous function converges to it. -/
