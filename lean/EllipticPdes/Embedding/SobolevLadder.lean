# Iterating the Sobolev ladder

One Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev step raises the exponent from `p` to `p'` with
`1/p' = 1/p - 1/d`, and `EllipticPdes.Embedding.morrey_ball` asks for `p' > d`. Starting from the
`L²` data an `H²` estimate delivers, a single step reaches `p' > d` only in dimensions one to
three, which is where `EllipticPdes.Embedding.exists_eLpNorm_six_le` and
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.exists_eLpNorm_four_le` stop.

Iterating the step reaches every dimension, at the price of consuming a weak derivative per
rung. The family that pays for it is one closed under differentiation: an index type `ι`, a
function `F i` for each index, and a successor `nxt i k` naming the `k`-th weak derivative of `F
i`. A solution with weak derivatives of every order has such a family, indexed by lists of
directions, and closure is what lets a single induction climb without bookkeeping of orders.

## Rungs

Each rung improves the reciprocal exponent by `1/(2d)` rather than the full `1/d` the inequality
allows. The half-step is deliberate. Starting at `1/2` and taking `d - 1` rungs of `1/(2d)` lands
at `1/(2d)`, so the exponent reached is `2d`, comfortably past `d`, while every intermediate
reciprocal `1/2 - s/(2d)` stays strictly positive for `s < d`. Full steps would land on `1/p' = 0`
in even dimensions and on `p' = d` exactly one rung earlier, both degenerate.

A rung consumes two exponents: the data sits at `q_s` with `1/q_s = 1/2 - s/(2d)`, the inequality
is applied at `p` with `1/p = 1/q_{s+1} + 1/d`, and `p ≤ q_s` holds by the half-step, so
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.exists_eLpNorm_sobolevConj_le_of_le` takes the drop from `q_s` to `p` on
the ball's finite measure. That `p` may sit below `2`, which is why the ladder is stated against
the exponent-lowering form of the bootstrap rather than the sharp one.

Each rung also shrinks the ball. The induction hands the shrinking back to its own hypothesis, so
the statement is between one fixed pair of radii `r < R` however many rungs it runs.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.memLp_of_gradClosed`: the ladder, at rung `s` and any exponent the rung
  reaches.
* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.memLp_two_mul_of_gradClosed`: the ladder run to the top, landing at
  `2d > d`, which is what `EllipticPdes.Embedding.morrey_ball` consumes.

/-! ### Reciprocal arithmetic

The ladder is bookkeeping on reciprocals, and every exponent it constructs is `Real.toNNReal` of
one. These three facts are all it asks of them, kept apart so the induction's own context stays
small.

/-! ### Ladder -/

/-- **The Sobolev ladder on a family closed under differentiation.** Let `F` assign a function to
each index of `ι`, let `nxt i k` name a weak `k`-derivative of `F i` on `Metric.ball c R`, and let
every `F i` lie in `L²` there. Then at rung `s < d` every `F i` lies in `Lq` on `Metric.ball c r`,
for any exponent `q ≥ 2` whose reciprocal is at least `1/2 - s/(2d)`.

The induction is on the rung. Each step splits the gap `r < R` at its midpoint, applies the
hypothesis at rung `s` on the outer half to the whole family at once, and takes one
Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev step on the inner half. Closure is what makes the second half work:
the gradient of `F i` is again a member of the family, so the hypothesis supplies its `Lq` bound
with no separate induction on the order of differentiation. -/
