# A family closed under differentiation is smooth

Put the two halves together. The Sobolev ladder raises every member of a family closed under weak
differentiation from `L²` to `L^{2d}` on an inner ball, Morrey turns that into a Hölder
representative, and the representatives inherit the weak gradients of the members they represent.
A continuous function with a continuous weak gradient is classically differentiable, so each
representative is differentiable with its derivative again in the family, and an induction on the
order reads that as `C^∞`.

Only one ball is lost, at the Morrey step. The ladder shrinks internally between the two radii it
is given, and the differentiability argument runs on the inner ball itself, since the derivative
of a representative is a representative. Were the derivative to cost a further shrinking, no
fixed ball would carry every order.

/-- **A family closed under weak differentiation has smooth representatives.** Let `F` assign a
function to each index, let `nxt i k` name a weak `k`-derivative of `F i` on `Metric.ball c R`,
and let every member lie in `L²` there. Then on any smaller concentric ball every member has a
representative smooth to every order.

The representatives are produced together, one per index, because the derivative of the
representative of `F i` has to be the representative of `F (nxt i k)` rather than some other
function agreeing with it almost everywhere. Continuity is what makes the choice rigid: two
continuous representatives of one class on an open ball are equal. -/
