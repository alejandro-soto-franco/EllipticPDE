# Full Poincaré inequality on the domain (dependency-chain step 3)

Average the `n` directional bounds from `poincare_slice_box` to obtain the
domain Poincaré inequality. Each coordinate direction `i` of the box contributes
a bound `∫_Ω u² ≤ c i * ∫_Ω (∂_i u)²`; summing over the `n` directions and
dividing by `n` gives `∫_Ω u² ≤ (1 / n) * ∑_i c i * ∫_Ω (∂_i u)²`. The resulting
constant is the domain constant `C_P` (for equal side lengths `c i = L² / 2` this
is `L² / (2 n)`, matching the diameter-based bound).

/-- The averaging step of the domain Poincaré inequality.

Given `n` bounds of the form `∫_Ω u² ≤ c i * ∫_Ω (d i)²`, one per index `i`,
this returns their average. The family `d : Fin n → α → ℝ` is arbitrary: nothing
here requires `d i` to be a derivative of `u`, `Ω` to be a box or a bounded
domain, or `μ` to be Lebesgue measure. Read on its own this is a statement about
families of real-valued functions.

All the Poincaré content sits in the caller, which supplies `hslice` with
`d i = ∂_i u` and pays for the geometry: `poincare_H01_euclBox` for a coordinate
box, `poincare_H01_of_bounded` for a bounded domain. Cite one of those when
citing the inequality itself. -/
