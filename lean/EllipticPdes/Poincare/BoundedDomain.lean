# Poincaré inequality on arbitrary bounded domains (chain step 5)

`BoxSlice.lean` discharges the per-direction slice bound when the domain IS the open
coordinate box. This file removes that restriction: any `Ω` contained in a box inherits
the slice bound, because a test function of `Ω` is a test function of the box
(`IsTestFn.mono`) and the box integrals restrict to `Ω` (the integrands vanish off
`tsupport φ ⊆ Ω`). Averaging (`poincare_testfn`) and density (`poincare_H01`) are already
domain-general, so the Poincaré inequality follows on every bounded domain
(`poincare_H01_of_bounded`), with the closed-form constant `L²/(2(n+1))` from any
bounding box of side `L`. This is the `p = q = 2` Friedrichs (Poincaré) inequality
for `H₀¹`; the limit passage from test functions to `H₀¹(Ω)` by density is the
density step `poincare_H01`, which is architectural here because `H₀¹` is defined
as the closure of the test-function graphs.

/-- **Poincaré inequality on `H₀¹` of an arbitrary bounded domain** (the
Friedrichs inequality, `p = q = 2`): some constant `C ≥ 0` controls the function part
by the gradient part, uniformly over `H₀¹(Ω)`.

Guo, *Partial Differential Equations* (JHU AS.110.631-632), Theorem III.4.6 states the
`W_0^{1,p}` form, `‖u‖_{L^q} ≤ C ‖Du‖_{L^p}` for `q ∈ [1, p*]`, and derives it from the
Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality. This declaration is its `p = q = 2` case, proved
on a different route and consequently in every dimension: Guo's hypothesis `p ∈ [1, n)`
reads `n > 2` at `p = 2`, excluding `n = 1` and `n = 2`, because the GNS route needs a
finite Sobolev conjugate. The route here goes through the one-dimensional inequality and
Fubini, which asks nothing of the dimension, with the constant `L²/(2(n+1))`
in place of the sharp one. -/

hypothesis. `poincare_H01_of_bounded` names the constant, so the only input is boundedness of
`Ω`. This is the form of coercivity the direct method uses, where the domain is a ball and no
box structure is at hand. -/
