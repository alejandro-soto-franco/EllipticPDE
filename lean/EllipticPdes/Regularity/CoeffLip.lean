# `W^{1,∞}` principal coefficients

Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 1 asks `aᵢⱼ ∈ C¹` for the
interior `H²` estimate, where Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture
Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2 (p. 65) asks `aᵢⱼ ∈ W^{1,∞}`. On `ℝᵈ` a `W^{1,∞}` function is one
with a Lipschitz representative, so in its pointwise form the hypothesis is the Lipschitz
estimate of `IsLipCoeff` below.

The estimate consumes the hypothesis through `abs_diffQuot_coeff_le` alone, which
`IsC1Coeff` supplies by the mean value inequality and a Lipschitz coefficient supplies
outright. `IsC1Coeff.toIsLipCoeff` is therefore what makes the `C¹` statement the instance:
the interior estimate, higher interior regularity and interior smoothness all run over
`IsLipCoeff` and no step of them asks a principal coefficient to be differentiable.

## Main declarations

* `IsLipCoeff`: the Lipschitz estimate on the principal coefficients.
* `IsLipCoeff.abs_diffQuot_coeff_le`: the coefficient difference-quotient bound.
* `IsC1Coeff.toIsLipCoeff`: the bridge, by the segment mean value inequality.

## Statements this file does not supply

The passage from an `IsWkInftyCoeff A 1` bundle, whose derivative bound is essential rather
than pointwise, to `IsLipCoeff`. That passage is the statement that a `W^{1,∞}` function has
a Lipschitz representative, and Mathlib has Rademacher's theorem in the opposite direction
alone (`LipschitzWith.ae_differentiableAt`). Until it is proved the two hypotheses are
distinct, and `interior_smooth` asks `IsLipCoeff` beside its `W^{k,∞}` bundles rather than
reading the first from the second.

/-- A `W^{1,∞}` ellipticity bundle in pointwise form: every entry of the coefficient matrix
satisfies the Lipschitz estimate with one constant `A₁`, and no entry is asked to be
differentiable. -/

/-- The coefficient difference quotient is uniformly bounded: for the `(i, j)` coefficient
entry, `|Dₖʰ aᵢⱼ(x)| ≤ A₁` for every `x` and every `h ≠ 0`. This is the pointwise
commutator bound used in the master interior estimate to control the coefficient-
difference-quotient term `∑ ∫ (Dₖʰ aᵢⱼ) ∂ᵢu · ∂ⱼ(ζ² Dₖʰ u)` (Evans, *Partial Differential
Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1), and it is the whole of what that estimate asks of the
principal coefficients beyond their bounds. -/

/-- **A `C¹` bundle is a `W^{1,∞}` bundle.** The segment mean value inequality turns the
pointwise bound on the first derivatives into the Lipschitz estimate with the same constant,
so a result proved under `IsLipCoeff` applies to a `C¹` coefficient and Guo's hypothesis is
no stronger than Evans's as far as the principal coefficients go. -/
