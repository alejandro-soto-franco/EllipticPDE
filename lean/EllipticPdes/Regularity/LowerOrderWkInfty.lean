# `W^{k,∞}` regularity for the transport and zeroth-order coefficients

`EllipticPdes.Sobolev.FullEllipticOp` gives `b` and `c` sup bounds and measurability and no
derivatives at all, which is everything the existence theory and the interior `H²` estimate
need. Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2
(p. 65) asks for `a_{ij} ∈ W^{k+2,∞}` and `b_i, c ∈ W^{k+1,∞}`, one order less on the lower-order
coefficients than on the principal part, because the lower-order terms are differentiated once
less often on the way to the same conclusion. This file supplies the missing hypothesis.

## Scalar predicate and bundle

`IsWkInfty f k` states the hypothesis for a single scalar function, and `IsWkInftyLower`
bundles it over the `d + 1` lower-order coefficients with a constant uniform across them.
Splitting it this way lets `IsWkInfty.deriv` be stated once and used for `b`, for `c`, and for
anything else the induction differentiates.

## Main declarations

* `IsWkInfty`: weak derivatives to order `k` of a scalar function, essentially bounded.
* `IsWkInfty.deriv`: an order-`k+1` bundle for `f` gives an order-`k` bundle for `∂_l f`.
* `IsWkInfty.ofContDiff`: a `Cᵏ` function with bounded derivatives satisfies it.
* `IsWkInfty.const`: a constant satisfies it at every order.
* `IsWkInftyCoeff.entry`: one entry of the coefficient matrix, as a scalar bundle.
* `IsWkInftyLower`: Guo's hypothesis on `b` and `c`, with a uniform constant.

/-! ### Scalar hypothesis -/

/-- **`f ∈ W^{k,∞}`**, given as data: a family of weak derivatives indexed by lists of
directions, each measurable and essentially bounded, with no continuity assumed. The order-zero
member is `f` itself, so `bound 0` is a sup bound on `f`. -/
structure IsWkInfty (f : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d) → ℝ) (k : ℕ) where
  /-- The chosen representative of the iterated weak derivative along a list of directions. -/
  D : List (Fin d) → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d) → ℝ
  /-- The empty list of directions is the function itself. -/
  D_nil : D [] = f
  /-- Every entry of the family is measurable. -/
  D_meas : ∀ α, α.length ≤ k → Measurable (D α)
  /-- Each successive entry is a weak partial derivative of its parent, up to order `k`. -/
  D_step : ∀ (l : Fin d) (α : List (Fin d)), α.length < k → HasWeakPartial l (D α) (D (l :: α))
  /-- The uniform bound on the derivatives of each order. -/
  bound : ℕ → ℝ
  /-- Every bound is nonnegative. -/
  bound_nonneg : ∀ m, 0 ≤ bound m
  /-- Each derivative of order `m ≤ k` is bounded by `bound m` almost everywhere. -/

    ∀ᵐ x ∂(volume : Measure (EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d))), |D α x| ≤ bound α.length

/-- **Differentiating the hypothesis.** From `f ∈ W^{k+1,∞}`, the first derivative `D [m]` is in
`W^{k,∞}`, with family `α ↦ D (α ++ [m])` and the bounds shifted by one order. Appending on the
right makes the lengths line up, exactly as in `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.deriv`, and this is the
step that lets the induction of Guo's Theorem VIII.3.2 keep its coefficient hypothesis. -/

one bound serves every order. The datum of the induction step has a term with no coefficient at
all, namely the derivative of the datum itself, and this is what lets it be treated as a
weighted term like the rest. -/

zeroth-order coefficient lie in `W^{k,∞}`, with one constant serving all of them. The uniform
constant is what the estimate of Theorem VIII.3.2 is stated against, so it is recorded here
rather than reconstructed as a maximum at the point of use. -/
