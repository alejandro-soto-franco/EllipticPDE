# Mollifying a `W^{1,∞}` weight

`EllipticPdes.Regularity.HasWeakDerivOn.mul_contDiff_left` proves the weak-derivative Leibniz
rule for a `C¹` weight, by mollifying the weight and differentiating the mollification
classically. Guo's hypothesis supplies no classical derivative, so that route is closed and the
mollification has to take the weak derivative instead. This file rebuilds the two facts about
mollification the Leibniz rule needs, with continuity of the weight dropped throughout.

* The sup bound survives with measurability alone. `EllipticPdes.Regularity` already had this
  for a continuous weight; continuity entered only through the integrability of the convolution
  integrand, which an essential bound supplies just as well.
* The derivative of the mollification is the mollification of the *weak* derivative. This is
  where the weak hypothesis does the work: the classical proof moves the derivative from the
  kernel back onto the weight by integration by parts, and `HasWeakPartial` is that
  integration-by-parts identity, applied to the reflected kernel `t ↦ ρ (x - t)`, which is a
  legitimate test function. The weak version is shorter than the `C¹` version it replaces.

## Main declarations

* `abs_convolution_le_of_measurable`: a mollification inherits an essential sup bound, at every
  point.
* `partialD_convolution_eq_of_hasWeakPartial`: `∂_ℓ (a ⋆ ρ) = a' ⋆ ρ` when `a'` is the weak
  `ℓ`-derivative of `a`.

/-! ### Sup bound with no continuity assumed -/

/-- **Sup bound for a mollification of an essentially bounded weight.** If `h` is measurable and
bounded by `M` almost everywhere, and `ρ` is a non-negative continuous compactly supported kernel
of unit mass, then `h ⋆ ρ` is bounded by `M` at every point.

Continuity of `h` is unused. It entered the `C¹` version only to make the integrand
`|h t| · ρ (x - t)` integrable, and domination by `M · ρ (x - t)` does that under an essential
bound alone. -/

/-- **Locality of a mollification.** If the kernel vanishes outside the ball of radius `r` and two
weights agree on the ball of radius `r` about `x`, their mollifications agree at `x`. This is
what lets a globally bounded weight, which lies in no `Lᵖ` on the whole space, be replaced near
a compact set by a truncation that does, without changing the mollification there. -/

derivative.** For `a` with weak `ℓ`-derivative `a'` and a smooth compactly supported kernel `ρ`,

The derivative first passes to the kernel, `∂_ℓ (a ⋆ ρ) = a ⋆ ∂_ℓ ρ`, which needs only local
integrability of `a`. Moving it back onto `a` is where the `C¹` proof integrates by parts, and
here it is the hypothesis: `HasWeakPartial` applied to the reflected kernel `t ↦ ρ (x - t)`
states exactly that identity, and `partialD_reflect` supplies the sign. -/
