# Infinite differentiability on the whole of the interior

`interior_smooth` produces a smooth representative on the interior of each compact `V ⋐ Ω`
separately, with nothing relating the representatives two different choices of `V` supply. This
file glues them into a single function smooth on the whole of `Ω`.

The gluing needs no construction of its own. Two representatives, one for a compact `V₁` and one
for a compact `V₂`, are continuous and agree almost everywhere with the same class wherever their
interiors meet, so they agree there; `exists_contDiffOn_of_compact_ae` is exactly this fact
packaged for a hypothesis stated over every compact subset of `Ω` at once, and applying it to the
family `interior_smooth` supplies is the whole proof.

## Main declarations

* `interior_smooth_global`: Evans's Theorem 3, with one representative smooth on all of `Ω`
  rather than on the interior of each compact exhaustion piece.

/-- **Infinite differentiability in the interior (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations*
(2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 3, p. 334), with one representative on all of `Ω`.** Under the
hypotheses of `interior_smooth`, the local representatives on the interior of every compact
`V ⊆ Ω` agree on the interiors they share, so `exists_contDiffOn_of_compact_ae` assembles them
into a single function smooth on the whole open set `Ω`, rather than merely on the interior of
each compact subset in turn. -/
