# Cutoff transport of weak derivatives to the ambient domain

The induction of Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem
VIII.3.2 (p. 65) runs on a pair `V ⋐ W ⋐ Ω`. The order-`k` conclusion is available on the
compact `W`, and the datum the induction hypothesis consumes needs its weak derivatives on all
of `Ω`. `EllipticPdes.Regularity.HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.restrict` moves a family the other way,
from `W` down to a smaller set, and is no help here.

Extension by zero is what closes the gap, and it needs the function to vanish near the boundary
of `W`. A cutoff supplies that: for a test function `χ` supported in `W`, the product `χ · p`
extended by zero to `Ω` has as many weak derivatives on `Ω` as `p` has on `W`.

## Keystone identity

Against a test function `φ` supported in `Ω`, the product `χ · φ` is a test function supported
in `tsupport χ ⊆ W`, so the weak derivative of `p` on `W` may be tested against it:

`∫_W p ∂_ℓ(χφ) = - ∫_W p' χφ`.

Expanding `∂_ℓ(χφ) = (∂_ℓχ)φ + χ(∂_ℓφ)` and moving the first summand across gives

`∫_W (χp) ∂_ℓφ = - ∫_W ((∂_ℓχ)p + χp') φ`,

and both sides may be read over `Ω` instead of `W`, since `χ` kills the integrand off `W`.
That is the statement that `(∂_ℓχ)p + χp'` is the weak `ℓ`-derivative of `χp` on `Ω`. Nothing
about `∂W` is needed, and no extension operator on Sobolev spaces appears: the cutoff does all
the work.

## Order-`k` family

The recursion is the one `EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_iteratedWeakDeriv_mul` uses. The
`ℓ`-derivative of `χ·p` is `(∂_ℓχ)·p + χ·(∂_ℓp)`, and each summand is again a test function
supported in `W` against a function with `k` weak derivatives on `W`, so the statement recurses
on its own conclusion. Test functions are closed under `partialD`, which is what lets the weight
change at each step without leaving the hypothesis.

## Main declarations

* `isTestFn_partialD`: test functions are closed under a classical partial derivative.
* `setIntegral_mul_mulTest_partialD`: the integration by parts the cutoff makes admissible.
* `HasWeakDerivOn.extend_mulTest`: one weak derivative, from `W` to `Ω`, across a cutoff.
* `hasWeakDeriv_extend_mulTest`: the same, on the whole space.
* `exists_iteratedWeakDeriv_extend_mulTest`: the order-`k` family and its bound.

/-! ### Integration by parts the cutoff makes admissible -/

/-- **Integration by parts against a cut-off test function.** For `χ` supported in `W` and a
weak `ℓ`-derivative `p'` of `p` on `W`,

`∫_W p · (χ ∂_ℓφ) = - ∫_W ((∂_ℓχ)p + χp') · φ`

for every smooth `φ`, asking neither compact support nor a support condition of it. The product
`χφ` is compactly supported in `tsupport χ ⊆ W` whatever `φ` does, so it is admissible for the
weak derivative, and expanding `∂_ℓ(χφ)` moves the term where the derivative lands on the
cutoff across.

This is the one identity the cutoff gives, and everything else in this file and in Evans's step
3 is bookkeeping around it. -/
