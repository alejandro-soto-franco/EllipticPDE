# Uniqueness of the whole-space weak derivative

`HasWeakDeriv k g g'` (`EllipticPdes.Regularity.DiffQuotientBound`) pins `g'` only through
its integrals against smooth compactly supported test functions. Those integrals determine
`g'` as an `L²` class, because the test classes are dense in `L²(ℝᵈ)`
(`MeasureTheory.Lp.dense_hasCompactSupport_contDiff`), so two weak `k`-derivatives of the same
class agree.

The identification steps of higher interior regularity (Evans, *Partial Differential
Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 2) produce a second derivative twice, once as a limit
of difference quotients and once through the Leibniz rule, and need them to be the same
class. This file supplies that step.

## Main declarations

* `annihilates_of_forall_testCls`: an `L²` class orthogonal to every smooth compactly
  supported class is zero.
* `HasWeakDeriv.unique`: the weak `k`-derivative is unique as an `L²` class.

/-- **Vanishing of an `L²` class orthogonal to every test class.** The classes of smooth compactly
supported functions are dense in `L²(ℝᵈ)`, and `y ↦ ⟪w, y⟫` is continuous, so a pairing that
vanishes on that family vanishes everywhere, in particular against `w` itself. -/
