# Cutting a test function against a cutoff

The localised moves of `EllipticPdes.Regularity.DifferentiatedEquation` are stated for test
functions supported inside the region `V` where the weak-derivative data lives. The terms of
higher interior regularity (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem
2) instead pair against a test function on the whole domain, each term with a factor supported
inside a compact `K ⊆ V`. Replacing the test function `φ` by `χ · φ` for a cutoff `χ`
identically `1` near `K` and supported in `V` brings the two shapes together.

The replacement is invisible to any factor supported in `K`: there `χ = 1` and `∂ⱼχ = 0`, so
the Leibniz expansion of `∂ⱼ(χ φ)` collapses to `∂ⱼφ`. Both facts need `χ = 1` on a
*neighbourhood* of `K`, which is the form `CutoffTower` (`EllipticPdes.Regularity.CutoffTower`)
records its three cutoffs in.

## Main declarations

* `partialD_eq_zero_of_eventually_one`: a function identically `1` near `K` has vanishing
  partials on `K`.
* `isTestFn_cut`: `χ · φ` is a test function on `V` whenever `χ` is a compactly supported
  smooth function with `tsupport χ ⊆ V` and `φ` is smooth.
* `mul_cut_eq`, `mul_partialD_cut_eq`: the pointwise cutting identities.
* `setIntegral_mul_cut_eq`, `setIntegral_mul_partialD_cut_eq`: their integral forms, for a
  weight vanishing almost everywhere off `K`.

/-! ### Two pointwise facts -/

/-- **A cutoff identically `1` near `K` has vanishing partials on `K`.** At a point of `K` the
function agrees with the constant `1` on a whole neighbourhood, so its Fréchet derivative is
the derivative of a constant. -/

/-- **The cut of a smooth function is a test function on `V`.** Smoothness is `ContDiff.mul`,
compact support comes from `χ`, and the support inclusion is the one `χ` has. Unlike
`isTestFn_mul`, the second factor need not be compactly supported. -/

/-- **Cutting is invisible to a weight supported in `K`**, at the level of the function
itself: `w · (χ φ) = w · φ` pointwise, because `χ = 1` on `K ⊇ tsupport w` and `w` vanishes
off its support. -/

/-- **Cutting is invisible to a weight supported in `K`**, at the level of the gradient:
`w · ∂ⱼ(χ φ) = w · ∂ⱼφ` pointwise. The Leibniz rule splits `∂ⱼ(χ φ)` into `χ ∂ⱼφ + (∂ⱼχ) φ`,
and on `K` the first factor is `∂ⱼφ` while the second vanishes. -/

everywhere off `K`, which is the form an `L²` class supported in `K` supplies. -/
