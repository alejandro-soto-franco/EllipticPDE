# Iterated weak derivatives on a region

The interior `H²` estimate `EllipticPdes.Regularity.interior_H2_estimate` produces one weak
derivative of one weak derivative, indexed by an explicit pair `(k, i)`. Higher regularity
iterates that step, so the pair has to become a list and the statement has to quantify over
its length. This file supplies the indexed object.

`HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V k u` names a family `D : List (Fin d) → L²(V)` with `D [] = u` and
each `D (l :: α)` a weak `l`-derivative of `D α`, for every list shorter than `k`. It is the
`L²`-level reading of `u ∈ H^k(V)`, given as data rather than as an existential, so that a proof
can name a particular derivative and hand it on.

## Choice of a list of directions

The same choice as in `EllipticPdes.Regularity.IsWkInftyCoeff`, and for the same reason: one
step of the recursion is `cons`. A multi-index in `Fin d →₀ ℕ` would need equality of mixed
partials before the recursion could even be stated, and that equality is a theorem about the
family rather than part of its definition. Nothing here presumes it.

## Main declarations

* `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn`: weak derivatives up to order `k` on `V`, given as a family.
* `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.mono`: an order-`k` family is an order-`l` family for `l ≤ k`.
* `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.deriv`: the order-`k` family of a first derivative, extracted from an
  order-`k+1` family by appending the direction on the right. This is the step the induction
  of Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2
  (p. 65) runs on.
* `IteratedL2Bound`: a uniform bound on every member of the family up to order `k`.

/-- **Iterated weak derivatives on a region.** A family of `L²(V)` classes indexed by lists of
directions, with the empty list the function itself and each `cons` a weak derivative of its
parent. Giving the family as data rather than asserting existence at each order lets a consumer
name `D [i, j]` and pass it on, which the induction of Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I
and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2 (p. 65) requires. -/

and `D_step` is asked of no list. -/
def zero (u : L2D V) : HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V 0 u where
  D := fun _ => u
  D_nil := rfl
  D_step := fun _ _ h => absurd h (Nat.not_lt_zero _)

/-- An order-`k` family is an order-`l` family for every `l ≤ k`: the family is inherited and
`D_step` is asked of fewer lists. -/

    HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V l u where
  D := hu.D
  D_nil := hu.D_nil
  D_step m α hα := hu.D_step m α (lt_of_lt_of_le hα hlk)

/-- **Transport along an equality of the subject.** The family is unchanged; only the proof
that its empty entry is the function moves. Stated because the induction reaches the derivative
of `u` through a cutoff, whose function coordinate agrees with the derivative on the region of
interest without being the same term. -/
def congr {g : L2D V} (hu : HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V k u) (h : u = g) :
    HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V k g where
  D := hu.D
  D_nil := hu.D_nil.trans h
  D_step := hu.D_step

/-- **The induction step.** From weak derivatives up to order `k + 1` of `u`, the direction
`l` first derivative `D [l]` has weak derivatives up to order `k`, with family
`α ↦ D (α ++ [l])`. Appending on the right rather than consing on the left is what makes the
lengths line up: `(α ++ [l]).length < k + 1` is exactly `α.length < k`, so every step the new
family needs is a step the old family already has.

This is the reduction that turns Guo's Theorem VIII.3.2 into an induction on `k`: an
`H^{k+2}` conclusion for `u` is an `H^{k+1}` conclusion for each `∂_l u`, and `∂_l u` solves a
differentiated equation of the same form. -/
def deriv (hu : HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V (k + 1) u) (l : Fin d) :

  D := fun α => hu.D (α ++ [l])
  D_nil := by simp
  D_step m α hα := by
    have hlen : (α ++ [l]).length < k + 1 := by
      simpa [List.length_append] using Nat.succ_lt_succ hα
    simpa using hu.D_step m (α ++ [l]) hlen

/-- **A first derivative, at two orders down.** The datum of the induction step multiplies
derivatives of the solution of order at most two, and asks each of them for `k` weak
derivatives of its own. Naming the two cases here rather than inlining them keeps the
definitional unfolding of `deriv` out of the assembly, where it is repeated a dozen times. -/
def deriv₁ (hu : HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V (k + 2) u) (i : Fin d) :
    HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V k (hu.D [i]) :=
  (hu.deriv i).mono (Nat.le_succ k)

    HasWeakDerivOn V m u (hu.D [m]) := by
  have h := hu.D_step m [] (Nat.succ_pos k)
  rwa [hu.D_nil] at h

/-- The assembly a family is read off: the empty list is the function, and a nonempty list is
the family of its last direction's derivative, indexed by what remains. Reversing is what makes
the last direction visible, since `D_step` conses on the left. -/
private def famAux (u : L2D V) (E : Fin d → List (Fin d) → L2D V) :
    List (Fin d) → L2D V
  | [] => u
  | (ℓ :: βr) => E ℓ βr.reverse

/-- **The inverse of `deriv`.** Weak derivatives in every direction, each with its own order-`k`
family, assemble into an order-`k + 1` family of the function itself. The index of the assembled
family reads `β ++ [ℓ]` as the `β`-entry of the family of `∂_ℓ u`, which is the convention
`deriv` uses in the other direction.

This is the step that carries the conclusion of the induction of Guo, *Partial Differential
Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2 (p. 65) back to the solution:
the induction hypothesis is applied to each `∂_ℓ u` and its conclusions are reassembled here. -/
