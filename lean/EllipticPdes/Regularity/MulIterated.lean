# Multiplying an iterated weak derivative by a `W^{k,∞}` weight

The datum of the differentiated equation is a sum of products, each a coefficient against a
derivative of the solution. Feeding that datum back into the induction of Guo, *Partial
Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2 (p. 65) needs weak
derivatives of the product up to order `k`, with a bound. This file supplies them.

## Recursion

`HasWeakDerivOn.mul_isWkInfty_left` gives one derivative of `a·g`, namely `(∂_ℓ a)·g + a·(∂_ℓ
g)`. Both summands are again products of a `W^{k,∞}` weight with a function with `k` weak
derivatives, so the statement recurses on its own conclusion. The family for `a·g` at order `k +
1` is therefore assembled rather than written down: the empty list is the product itself, and a
list `ℓ :: α` reads the order-`k` family built for the `ℓ`-derivative.

No Leibniz formula over subsets of the index list appears, and none is needed. Naming the
derivative of each order through the recursion avoids the combinatorial statement altogether,
with a constant that is existentially quantified rather than computed. The estimate
of Theorem VIII.3.2 quantifies its constant before the solution and the datum and says nothing
about its size, so nothing is lost.

## Main declarations

* `HasWeakDerivOn.add`, `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.add`: sums.
* `mulL2`: a bounded measurable weight acting on an `L²(V)` class.
* `exists_iteratedWeakDeriv_mul`: the product has `k` weak derivatives, with a bound linear in
  the bound on the family of `g`.

/-! ### Product rule at every order -/

/-- **Preservation of `k` weak derivatives by a `W^{k,∞}` weight.** For `a ∈ W^{k,∞}` there is a
constant `K`, depending on the bundle alone, such that whenever `g` has weak derivatives to order
`k` on `V` bounded by `M`, every class representing `a·g` has weak derivatives to order `k`
bounded by `K·M`.

The induction is on `k`. The step applies `HasWeakDerivOn.mul_isWkInfty_left` once to obtain
`∂_ℓ(a·g) = (∂_ℓ a)·g + a·(∂_ℓ g)`, then the induction hypothesis to each summand, the first with
the weight `∂_ℓ a ∈ W^{k,∞}` and the second with the function `∂_ℓ g`, whose order-`k` family is
`HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.deriv`. -/
