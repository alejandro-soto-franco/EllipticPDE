# Infinite differentiability in the interior

Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 3 (*Infinite
differentiability in the interior*, p. 331). Smooth coefficients and a smooth datum give a
solution smooth in the interior, whatever the boundary does.

The route is the one the chapter takes. Higher interior regularity, run at every order, puts
the solution in `H^m(V)` for every `m`; the Sobolev embedding then converts an unbounded supply
of weak derivatives into classical ones. Neither half needs a quantitative statement: the
constants of `higher_interior_regularity` are what make the estimate uniform, and smoothness on
a fixed `V` needs only that the derivatives exist.

## What the embedding half requires

Weak derivatives of every order are handed over one family per order, with nothing relating them,
so the embedding half starts by assembling them into a single family closed under
differentiation. Uniqueness of the weak gradient on a ball is what identifies the entries two
families share (`EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_gradClosed_of_hasIteratedWeakDerivOn`).

From there it is two steps.

* `EllipticPdes.Embedding.memLp_of_gradClosed` raises every member of the family from `L²` to
  `L^{2d}`, iterating the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev step and paying a weak derivative per rung.
  Since `2d > d` in every dimension, `EllipticPdes.Embedding.morrey_ball` then puts every member
  in a Hölder class, so the whole family becomes continuous at once.
* A continuous function with a continuous weak gradient is classically differentiable with that
  gradient (`EllipticPdes.Embedding.hasFDerivAt_of_continuousOn_hasWeakGradOn`). The derivative
  of a representative is the representative of the derivative, so an induction on the order reads
  the family as `C^∞` without shrinking the ball again
  (`EllipticPdes.Embedding.contDiffOn_of_gradClosed`).

## Main declarations

* `contDiffOn_interior_of_hasIteratedWeakDerivOn`: weak derivatives of every order give a
  smooth representative on the interior.
* `interior_smooth`: Evans's Theorem 3.

/-- **The Sobolev ladder on a ball.** An `L²` class carrying weak derivatives of every order
has a smooth representative on any ball whose closure sits inside the region.

This is the analytic content of Evans's Theorem 3, and it is three steps.

* The families of `EllipticPdes.Regularity.HasIteratedWeakDerivOn`, one per order and unrelated
  to each other, become one family closed under differentiation
  (`EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_gradClosed_of_hasIteratedWeakDerivOn`), by uniqueness of the
  weak gradient on a ball.
* The ladder `EllipticPdes.Embedding.memLp_two_mul_of_gradClosed` raises every member of that
  family from `L²` to `L^{2d}`, which passes `d` in every dimension, so
  `EllipticPdes.Embedding.morrey_ball` gives each a Hölder representative.
* A continuous function with a continuous weak gradient is classically differentiable
  (`EllipticPdes.Embedding.hasFDerivAt_of_continuousOn_hasWeakGradOn`), and the derivative of a
  representative is the representative of the derivative, so an induction on the order reads the
  family as `C^∞` (`EllipticPdes.Embedding.contDiffOn_of_gradClosed`).

The argument is local, so it runs on balls small enough for the ladder to shrink inside, and
`exists_contDiffOn_of_locally_ae` collects the local representatives. The closed ball is asked
for so that every point of the open one has room for that shrinking. -/

/-- **The Sobolev ladder, qualitative form.** An `L²` class on `V` carrying weak derivatives of
every order has a representative smooth on the interior of `V`. No bound is asked and none is
produced: the estimate lives in `higher_interior_regularity`, and smoothness on a fixed set
follows from the existence of the derivatives alone.

The proof is local, so it runs on balls inside `interior V` and never sees `V` itself except
through the family it is handed. `exists_contDiffOn_of_locally_ae` assembles the local
representatives, and it needs no gluing: two of them are continuous and agree almost everywhere
where their balls meet, so they agree there. -/

/-- **Infinite differentiability in the interior (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations*
(2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 3, p. 334).** For a weak solution of `L u = f` whose coefficients lie
in `W^{k,∞}` at every order and whose datum has weak derivatives of every order in `L²(Ω)`, the
solution has a representative smooth on the interior of each compact `V ⋐ Ω`.

Smooth coefficients meet the hypothesis through `IsCkCoeff.toIsWkInftyCoeff` and
`IsWkInfty.ofContDiff`, so the classical statement with `a_{ij}, b_i, c, f ∈ C^∞(Ω)` follows as
an instance. -/
