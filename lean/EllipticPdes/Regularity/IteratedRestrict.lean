# Iterated weak derivatives pass to a smaller region

The induction of Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes),
Theorem VIII.3.2 (p. 65) runs on a pair `V ⋐ W ⋐ Ω`: the cutoff lives on `W`, the conclusion
is asked on `V`, and the datum's regularity is established on whichever of the two is
convenient. Moving a family between them is the bookkeeping this file removes.

A weak derivative on `W` is tested against every test function supported in `W`, and a test
function supported in `V ⊆ W` is one of them. Both integrals then localise to `V`, since the
integrands vanish off the support. The bound comes along because extension by zero preserves
the norm and restriction does not increase it.

## Main declarations

* `HasWeakDerivOn.restrict`: a weak derivative on `W` restricts to one on `V ⊆ W`.
* `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.restrict`: the family.
* `IteratedL2Bound.restrict`: the bound, with the same constant.
