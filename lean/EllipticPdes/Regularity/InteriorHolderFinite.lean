# Guo's Sobolev embedding, second case

Guo, *Partial Differential Equations*, Theorem IV.2.3: for `u ∈ W^{m,p}(Ω)` with `m > n/p`, the
conclusion is `u ∈ C^{m-1-⌊n/p⌋, γ}(Ω)`. This file states and proves the case `p = 2`, locally,
from the supply of weak derivatives the interior regularity theory produces.

## The order and the exponent

An order-`m` supply of weak derivatives in `L²` gives classical derivatives up to
`k = m - 1 - ⌊d/2⌋`, and the top ones are Hölder-`1/2`. The order is Guo's on the nose. The
exponent is his too when `d` is odd, where `⌊d/2⌋ + 1 - d/2 = 1/2`; when `d` is even his `γ` is
free in `(0, 1)` and `1/2` is the choice
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.contDiffOn_holder_of_gradClosed` fixes.

The hypothesis `m > d/2` Guo asks for is `k + 1 + ⌊d/2⌋ ≤ m` here, at `k = 0`.

## Multi-index form

The conclusion is stated over lists of directions, as Guo states his over multi-indices. The
entry `v α` is the partial derivative of `v []` along `α`, which the last component of the
conclusion says exactly: on the ball the classical derivative of `v α` is the tuple of the
`v (j :: α)`. So `C^{k, 1/2}` reads as it should, that every partial derivative of order at most
`k` exists classically and is Hölder-`1/2`.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_contDiffOn_holder_ball_of_hasIteratedWeakDerivOn`: the
  multi-index form.
* `EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_contDiffOn_holder_ball`: the same read at the root.

/-- **Guo's second case, in multi-index form.** An `L²` class with weak derivatives up to order
`m` on `V`, and `k + 1 + ⌊d/2⌋ ≤ m`, has on any ball compactly inside `V` a family of
representatives indexed by lists of directions: the empty list represents the class, every list
of length at most `k` is Hölder-`1/2` and of class `C^{k - |α|}`, and each is the classical
derivative of its parent.

The supply is spent in three places. Morrey takes the weak gradient, the ladder takes `⌊d/2⌋`
more raising it to `L^{2d}`, and reading the order-`k` derivative asks the same of everything `k`
levels up, which together are the `k + 1 + ⌊d/2⌋` of the hypothesis. -/
