# Uniform ellipticity from pointwise positive definiteness

`SmoothOpOn.elliptic` asks directly for a uniform ellipticity constant on `U`. In practice a
coefficient matrix is more often known through pointwise positive definiteness together with
continuity, with no uniform constant given in advance: this file supplies the compactness
argument that produces one on any compact subset, an alternative route to discharging
`SmoothOpOn.elliptic` when `U` is exhausted by compact sets.

The constant comes from a minimum of the quadratic form over the compact product of the base set
with the unit sphere of directions, which is positive because the integrand is, by continuity and
compactness of that product.

## Main declarations

* `exists_uniform_elliptic_of_continuousOn`: a matrix field continuous and pointwise positive
  definite on a compact set is uniformly elliptic there, with an explicit ellipticity constant.

/-- **Uniform ellipticity on a compact set from pointwise positivity.** A matrix field continuous
on a compact `K` and positive definite at every point of `K` is uniformly elliptic on `K`. The
constant is a minimum of the quadratic form over `K` against the unit sphere of directions,
attained and positive by continuity and compactness. -/
