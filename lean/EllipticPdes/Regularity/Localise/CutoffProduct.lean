# Cutting a locally smooth function off to a globally smooth one

The interior-regularity chain runs on a `FullEllipticOp`, whose coefficients are global on
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`, essentially bounded, and asked for no more. A datum smooth on an
open set `U` alone, or coefficients smooth on `U` alone with no bound off it, do not meet that
shape directly. Multiplying by a smooth cutoff supported in `U` and equal to `1` near the region
of interest repairs this: the product is globally smooth, compactly supported, and so lies in
`W^{k,∞}` at every order, with no bound needed on the factor itself.

This file supplies that cutting-off step in general, for a single scalar function; `LocalOp`
applies it entrywise to build a global operator out of one with coefficients smooth on `U` alone.

## Main declarations

* `contDiff_mul_of_contDiffOn`: a function smooth on `U`, cut off by a test function of `U`, is
  globally smooth.
* `hasCompactSupport_mul`: the product has compact support.
* `exists_iteratedFDeriv_bound`: a smooth compactly supported function has every iterated
  derivative uniformly bounded.
* `exists_iteratedFDeriv_bound_const_add`: the same for a constant shift of one, at every
  positive order.
* `nonempty_isWkInfty`: a smooth compactly supported function lies in `W^{k,∞}` at every order.

/-- A function smooth on an open `U`, multiplied by a test function supported in `U`, is
globally smooth: away from the topological support of the cutoff the product is eventually zero,
and on that support the cutoff itself is smooth wherever `g` is, since the support sits inside
`U`. -/

/-- A smooth compactly supported function has every iterated derivative bounded, with a
nonnegative bound at each order: the derivative is continuous and vanishes off a compact set, so
it is bounded, and the bound is truncated at `0` to be usable at every order uniformly. -/
