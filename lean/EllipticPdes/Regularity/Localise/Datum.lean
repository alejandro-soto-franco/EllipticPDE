# The datum bridge and the localisation of a local weak solution

`interior_smooth` asks for a datum `f : L2D Ω` with weak derivatives of every order in `L²(Ω)`,
each bounded in `L²`, and for the equation to hold in the weak sense against every `w ∈ H01 Ω`.
Evans §6.3.1, Theorem 3 hypothesises a datum smooth on `Ω` and a solution posed only locally,
against test functions compactly supported in the region rather than against every member of
`H01 Ω`. This file supplies both bridges.

* A smooth compactly supported function already has every weak derivative in `L²`, by its
  classical iterated partials (`iteratedWeakDerivOfContDiff`), so `datum_hyp` discharges the
  datum hypothesis of `interior_smooth` outright.
* `LocalWeakSol` states the local weak formulation on plain function representatives, tested
  only against functions compactly supported in the region. `localise` reduces a local weak
  solution of an equation with coefficients and datum smooth on `U`, near a compact `K ⊆ U`, to
  a local weak solution on a smaller open `W` of an equation with the global bounded-measurable
  coefficients `localOp` supplies and a smooth compactly supported datum, cut off from the
  original by the same cutoff.

Neither bridge touches the global weak formulation against every member of `H01 Ω`: that is the
remaining interface between a local weak solution and `interior_smooth`, left to a later module
that connects `LocalWeakSol` to a predicate `IsLocalWeakSolution` on the ambient space.

## Main declarations

* `toL2`, `iteratedWeakDerivOfContDiff`, `datum_hyp`: the datum bridge.
* `LocalWeakSol`: a local weak solution on plain representatives, with `congr`, `mono`.
* `localise`: the localisation step of Evans §6.3.1, Theorem 3.

/-- **Localisation step of Evans §6.3.1, Theorem 3.** A local weak solution on `U` of the
equation with coefficients and datum smooth on `U` is, near every compact `K ⊆ U`, a local weak
solution on an open `W ⋐ U` of an equation with the global bounded-measurable coefficients
`localOp` supplies, meeting every mixin `interior_smooth` asks for, and a smooth compactly
supported datum. This is the passage from Evans's classical hypotheses to the `FullEllipticOp`
shape the interior-regularity chain runs on; only the global weak formulation against every
member of `H01 Ω` remains, and it is the sibling interface a later module supplies. -/
