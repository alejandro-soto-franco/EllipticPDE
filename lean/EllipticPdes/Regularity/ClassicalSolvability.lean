# Solvability and interior smoothness composed

Existence supplies a weak solution and the interior theory supplies a smooth representative of
it. This file puts the two together, which is the regularity half of classical solvability: for
coefficients and a datum of every order, the Dirichlet problem has a weak solution with a
representative that is `C^∞` on the interior of every compact subset of the domain.

The pointwise equation is the step this file does not take. A `C^∞` representative on the
interior satisfies the equation there by the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations,
which `EllipticPdes.Regularity.PointwiseEquation` proves and
`EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_weakSolution_interior_classical` composes with this result.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_weakSolution_interior_smooth`: a weak solution together with
  its smooth interior representative.

/-- **A weak solution with a smooth interior representative.** On a bounded domain, for an
operator with no transport term and a nonnegative zeroth-order coefficient, whose diffusion is
`C¹` and whose coefficients lie in `W^{k,∞}` at every order, and for a datum with weak
derivatives of every order bounded in `L²`, the Dirichlet problem has a weak solution whose
class has a `C^∞` representative on the interior of every compact subset of the domain. -/
