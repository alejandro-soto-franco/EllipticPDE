# Identifications on the collar

The inductive hypothesis of Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture
Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2 (p. 65) hands over a family of iterated weak derivatives on a compact
set, and says of its first entries only that they are weak derivatives of the solution. The
ambient element has its own first derivatives, in its gradient coordinates. The two agree, but
only almost everywhere, and only where a cutoff is invisible.

`EllipticPdes.Regularity.mulTest_weakDerivOn_unique` gives the agreement after a cutoff. On an
open collar where the outer cutoff of the tower is identically `1`, the cutoff drops out and the
two families become equal as `L²` classes on the collar. Running the induction step there rather
than on the compact set is what lets a single family supply every derivative the datum needs.

## Main declarations

* `restrictL2_extendL2_trans`: restricting twice is restricting once.
* `restrictL2_extendL2_eq_of_mulTest_eq`: an identification after a cutoff becomes an equality
  on the collar.
* `restrictL2_extendL2_congr_of_weakDerivOn`: two weak derivatives of one class are equal on the
  collar.
* `exists_restrictFamily`, `exists_collarFamily`: a family and its bound, moved in one step.

/-- **Restricting twice is restricting once.** For `N ⊆ W`, cutting an `L²(Ω)` class down to
`W` and then to `N` is cutting it down to `N`. The two sets need no relation to `Ω`, since the
whole-space extension is what both restrictions read. -/

/-- **Inductive family moved to the collar.** A family on `W` for the whole-space
extension of `g`, restricted to `N`, is a family there for the same class, with the same bound,
and its first entries are the given weak derivatives of `g`.

The three conclusions travel together because the induction step needs all three and each is a
unification the elaborator should do once. Doing them inline takes minutes, since the step's
context has the tower, its collar, four cutoffs and the datum by the time it needs them. -/
