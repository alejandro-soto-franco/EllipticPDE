# The outer cutoff tower, and second derivatives near `tsupport ξ`

Higher interior regularity (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1,
Theorem 2) runs the interior `H²` estimate a second time, on the cutoff derivative
`ξ · ∂_ℓu` rather than on `u`. The commutator terms it produces are supported inside
`tsupport ξ` of the first tower, so the second run needs its own tower, based at that compact
set rather than at the original `V`, together with the second derivatives of `u` there.

Both come for free from what the interior `H²` chain already provides. `tsupport ξ` is
compact and sits inside `Ω`, so `cutoffTowerOfIsCompactSubsetIsOpen` builds the outer tower,
and `interior_secondWeakDeriv` and `interior_H2_estimate` apply at that compact set verbatim.

## Main declarations

* `outerCutoffTower`: a cutoff tower based at `tsupport T.ξ`.
* `outer_secondWeakDeriv`: the interior second derivatives at the outer tower, as whole-space
  `EucL2 d` classes with one constant covering every direction pair.
* `interior_H2_estimate_near_tsupport_xi`: the interior `H²` estimate on `tsupport T.ξ`.

/-! ### The outer tower -/

/-- **The outer cutoff tower.** A tower based at the compact set `tsupport T.ξ` of a given
tower `T`. Its innermost cutoff is identically `1` on `tsupport T.ξ`
(`CutoffTower.zeta_eqOn_one`), which is what makes it invisible to every term of the
differentiated equation. -/

/-! ### Second derivatives at the outer tower -/

/-- **The interior second derivatives at the outer tower.** For every direction pair `(k, i)`
the whole-space extension of `ζ' · ∂ᵢu`, with `ζ'` the innermost cutoff of the outer tower,
carries an `L²` weak `k`-derivative bounded by the data, with a single constant covering the
whole index square. The constant is quantified before the solution and the datum, so it
depends only on the operator and the tower. This is `interior_secondWeakDeriv` at
`outerCutoffTower`, with the per-pair constants collected into one. -/

/-- **The interior `H²` estimate on `tsupport T.ξ`.** The middle cutoff of a tower has
compact support inside `Ω`, so the interior `H²` estimate applies at that set: the second
weak derivatives of `u` exist in `L²(tsupport T.ξ)` and are bounded by the data. This is the
regularity of `u` the differentiated equation consumes on the region where the cutoff
commutators live. -/
