# Difference quotients on `L²(ℝⁿ)`

The difference quotient `Dₖʰ u(x) = (u(x + h eₖ) - u(x)) / h` drives the interior regularity
theory (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §5.8.2 and §6.3.1). It is realised
here as a continuous linear map on the whole-space space `EucL2 d`, built from the translation
isometry `transL2`, so that its adjoint and norm bounds descend from translation invariance of
Lebesgue measure.

/-- Translation by `v` is adjoint to translation by `-v` in the real `L²` inner product:
`⟪τ_v u, w⟫ = ⟪u, τ_{-v} w⟫`. This is the continuous shadow of discrete summation by
parts, and rests on translation invariance of Lebesgue measure (Evans, *Partial
Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §5.8.2). -/

/-- **Discrete integration by parts.** The difference quotient `Dₖʰ` is adjoint, up to a
sign, to the backward difference quotient `Dₖ⁻ʰ`: `⟪Dₖʰ u, w⟫ = -⟪u, Dₖ⁻ʰ w⟫`. This is
the discretised analogue of integration by parts underlying the Caccioppoli-type interior
estimate (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §5.8.2, proof of Theorem 3). -/
