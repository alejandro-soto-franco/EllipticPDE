# Weak limits of difference quotients

The `H^k` bootstrap of Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 2
runs the interior `H²` estimate on a directional derivative `∂_ℓ u`. In the graph encoding of
`EllipticPdes.Sobolev.Basic` that derivative has to be produced as a limit of the discrete
family `Dₖ^h u`, and the limit is taken weakly, so this file supplies the two weak-limit
facts the bootstrap needs.

The first is weak sequential compactness of a bounded sequence in a separable real Hilbert
space, which is the abstract form of `EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_weak_limit_of_bounded`:
the difference-quotient engine needs it on the ambient graph space `H1amb Ω`, not only on the
whole-space `EucL2 d` where that theorem states it.

The second is weak `L²` convergence of the difference quotients themselves. The bound
`norm_diffQuot_le_of_hasWeakDeriv` makes the family uniformly bounded, and against a smooth
compactly supported test the discrete integration-by-parts identity together with the strong
convergence `Dₖ^{-h} φ → ∂ₖφ` identifies the limit as the weak derivative; density of the
smooth compactly supported classes then upgrades the test class to an arbitrary one.

## Main declarations

* `exists_weak_limit_of_bounded_hilbert`: weak sequential compactness in a separable real
  Hilbert space.
* `tendsto_inner_of_dense_of_bounded`: a uniformly bounded sequence converging weakly against a
  dense set converges weakly against every vector.
* `tendsto_inner_diffQuot_of_hasWeakDeriv`: `Dₖ^{hₘ} g ⇀ g'` whenever `g'` is the weak
  `k`-derivative of `g` and `hₘ → 0` through nonzero steps.

/-! ### Weak sequential compactness in a separable real Hilbert space -/

/-- **Weak sequential compactness of bounded sequences.** A sequence bounded by `M` in a
separable real Hilbert space has a subsequence converging weakly to a limit `g'` with
`‖g'‖ ≤ M`. This is `EllipticPdes.Regularity.exists_weak_limit_of_bounded` with the whole-space
`L²` substrate replaced by an abstract space, so that it also applies to the ambient graph
space `H1amb Ω`. Assembled from the sequential Banach-Alaoglu theorem on the weak dual
(`WeakDual.isSeqCompact_closedBall`), the Riesz self-duality of the Hilbert space
(`InnerProductSpace.toDual`), and the closed-ball membership of the weak-\* limit. -/

/-! ### Upgrading weak convergence from a dense set -/

/-- **Density upgrade for weak convergence.** A sequence bounded by `M`, whose weak limit
candidate is also bounded by `M`, and which converges weakly against every vector of a dense
set, converges weakly against every vector: split the pairing across a nearby dense vector and
spend a third of the tolerance on each of the three pieces. -/

/-! ### Weak convergence of the difference quotients -/

/-- **Weak `L²` convergence of difference quotients (Evans §5.8.2).** If `g'` is the weak
`k`-derivative of `g` in `L²(ℝᵈ)` and the steps `ηₘ → 0` are nonzero, then
`Dₖ^{ηₘ} g ⇀ g'` weakly in `L²`. Against a smooth compactly supported test the discrete
integration-by-parts identity `⟪Dₖ^h g, φ⟫ = -⟪g, Dₖ^{-h} φ⟫` together with the strong
convergence `Dₖ^{-ηₘ} φ → ∂ₖφ` gives the limit `-⟪g, ∂ₖφ⟫ = ⟪g', φ⟫`, and the uniform bound
`‖Dₖ^h g‖ ≤ ‖g'‖` extends it to every test class by density. -/
