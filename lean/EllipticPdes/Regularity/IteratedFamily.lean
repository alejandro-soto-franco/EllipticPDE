# One family closed under differentiation

Higher interior regularity is proved order by order, so a solution with weak derivatives of every
order arrives as one `EllipticPdes.Regularity.HasIteratedWeakDerivOn` per order, and nothing in
the statement relates the entries two of them share. The Sobolev ladder needs the opposite: a
single family, closed under differentiation, so that the derivative of a member is again a
member.

Uniqueness of the weak gradient supplies the relation. On a ball inside the region the entries
two families assign to one list of directions agree almost everywhere, by induction along the
list, so reading each list off the family of its own length gives a family closed under
differentiation up to a null set, which is all the ladder reads.

/-- **Weak derivatives of every order give one family closed under differentiation.** On a ball
inside the region, the functions `F α` read off the order-`α.length` family have, for each
direction `k`, the function `F (k :: α)` as a weak `k`-derivative, and all of them lie in `L²`.
The empty list is the function itself, on the nose.

The induction along the list is where uniqueness is spent: the entries at `α` of two families
agree almost everywhere by the inductive hypothesis, so the two weak gradients they have are
weak gradients of one function, hence agree, which is the inductive step at `k :: α`. -/
