# Linear algebra of iterated weak derivatives

The datum of the differentiated equation is a finite sum of signed terms, each a bounded
weight against a derivative of the solution. `EllipticPdes.Regularity.MulIterated` supplies
the weight; this file supplies the sum.

Everything here is the same observation at three levels: weak differentiation is linear, so
an order-`k` family of a sum is the entrywise sum of the families, and the triangle inequality
turns a bound on each summand into a bound on the sum. The constants add rather than being
optimised, which is all the induction of Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II*
(Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2 (p. 65) needs: its constant is quantified before the
solution and the datum, and nothing constrains its size.

## Main declarations

* `HasWeakDerivOn.zero`, `HasWeakDerivOn.neg`, `HasWeakDerivOn.sum`: linearity of the weak
  derivative on a region.
* `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn.neg`, `.sub`, `.sum`: the families.
* `IteratedL2Bound.add`, `.neg`, `.sub`, `.sum`: the bounds.
