# `H^k` norm of an iterated family

Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §5.2.2 (p. 259) defines

`‖u‖_{W^{k,p}(U)} = (Σ_{|α| ≤ k} ∫_U |D^α u|^p dx)^{1/p}`

for multi-indices `α`. A family `HasIteratedWeakDerivOn V k u` indexes derivatives by lists of
directions, one list per ordered sequence of differentiations, so a multi-index of order `j`
corresponds to as many lists as it has orderings. `iteratedNorm` is the same sum taken over
lists:

`iteratedNorm H = (Σ_{j ≤ k} Σ_{α ∈ (Fin d)^j} ‖D_α u‖²_{L²(V)})^{1/2}`.

Weak derivatives commute, so each multi-index contributes its `L²` norm squared with the
multiplicity of its orderings, between `1` and `j!`; the two norms are equivalent with constants
depending on `d` and `k` alone. Weak derivatives on an open set are unique, so the value does
not depend on the family chosen.

## Main declarations

* `iteratedNorm`: the norm.
* `norm_D_le_iteratedNorm`: every entry of the family is bounded by it.
* `iteratedNorm_le`: a uniform bound on the entries bounds it, with a constant in `d` and `k`.
