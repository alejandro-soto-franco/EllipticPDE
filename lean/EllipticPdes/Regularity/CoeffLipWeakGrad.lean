# Weak gradient of a `W^{1,infinity}` coefficient

`IsLipCoeff` is the hypothesis the interior estimate reads, and the cutoff reduction that
takes the estimate from `H_0^1(Omega)` to `H^1(Omega)` reads one thing more: a weak gradient
of each coefficient entry, essentially bounded, which `CoeffWeakGrad` bundles. A `C^1`
coefficient supplies it through its classical partials (`IsC1Coeff.coeffWeakGrad`) and a
`W^{k+1,infinity}` family through its first order (`IsWkInftyCoeff.coeffWeakGrad`). This file
supplies it from the Lipschitz estimate alone, which is what Guo, *Partial Differential
Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.2.2 (p. 63) and Gilbarg-Trudinger,
*Elliptic Partial Differential Equations of Second Order*, Theorem 8.8 (p. 179) ask of the
leading coefficients.

## The argument

Rademacher's theorem (`LipschitzWith.ae_differentiableAt`) gives a derivative almost
everywhere, and `fderiv` names it: the total `fderiv` of Mathlib is the derivative where one
exists and zero elsewhere, so `coeffDa A l i j` below is measurable (`measurable_fderiv`) and
bounded by the Lipschitz constant wherever the derivative exists
(`norm_fderiv_le_of_lipschitz`).

That it is the weak derivative is the difference quotient identity
`∫ a(x) (φ(x - h e_l) - φ(x))/h = ∫ ((a(x + h e_l) - a(x))/h) φ(x)`,
exact for every `h ≠ 0` by translation invariance of the volume, taken to the limit along
`h = 1/(n+1)`. On the left the quotient of `φ` converges uniformly to `-∂_l φ` and is
supported in one compact set for every `h ≤ 1`; on the right the quotient of `a` is bounded
by `A₁` and converges almost everywhere by Rademacher. Dominated convergence on each side
gives `∫ a ∂_l φ = -∫ (da) φ`.

## Main declarations

* `IsLipCoeff.lipschitzWith`: the estimate as a `LipschitzWith` statement.
* `coeffDa`: the chosen representative of `∂_l a_{ij}`.
* `measurable_coeffDa`, `IsLipCoeff.abs_da_le`: its measurability and its bound, the
  bound being pointwise rather than essential, since `fderiv` is zero off the differentiability
  set.

## What this file does not yet supply

`HasWeakPartial l (fun x => A.a x i j) (coeffDa A l i j)`, and with it
`IsLipCoeff.coeffWeakGrad`. The route is the one described above: the difference quotient
identity by `measurePreserving_translate` and `MeasurePreserving.integral_comp`, then
`tendsto_integral_of_dominated_convergence` on each side, the almost-everywhere convergence
of the quotient of `a` coming from `LipschitzWith.ae_differentiableAt` through
`hasDerivAt_iff_tendsto_slope`. Until it is proved, the cutoff reduction of
`interior_H2_estimate_W12` reads a `C¹` bundle and the `H^1` statements of the interior
theory ask `C¹` of the principal coefficients where Guo VIII.2.2 and Gilbarg-Trudinger 8.8
ask `W^{1,∞}`.
