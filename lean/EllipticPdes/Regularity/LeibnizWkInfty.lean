# Leibniz rule for a `W^{1,∞}` weight

`EllipticPdes.Regularity.HasWeakDerivOn.mul_contDiff_left` proves the weak-derivative product
rule for a `C¹` weight. Guo's hypothesis supplies no classical derivative, and this file
replaces that route.

## Smooth case

For a weight that is already `C^∞`, no mollification is needed at all and no product rule for
weak derivatives has to be proved: `b · φ` is itself a smooth compactly supported test function
supported where `φ` is, so it may be fed straight to `HasWeakDerivOn`, and the classical
Leibniz rule splits the result. That is `weakDerivOn_smul_test_contDiff` below, and it is the
whole content of the mollified stage.

## Entry point of the weak hypothesis

The mollification `a ⋆ ρ_ε` of a `W^{1,∞}` weight is `C^∞`, and its derivative is the
mollification of the weak derivative (`partialD_convolution_eq_of_hasWeakPartial`). Feeding it to
the smooth case gives the identity for every `ε`, and what remains is to pass to the limit.

## Passing to the limit

The `C¹` route mollifies and lets dominated convergence carry the limit, which needs
`a ⋆ ρ_ε → a` pointwise and so needs `a` continuous. A merely measurable weight has no such
convergence, and the limit is taken in `L²` instead: the pairing is bounded by Cauchy-Schwarz
(`abs_setIntegral_mul_le`), leaving `‖a ⋆ ρ_ε - a‖_{L²}` on the support of the test function.

A bounded weight lies in no `Lᵖ` on the whole space, so the `L²` convergence of
`EllipticPdes.Embedding.tendsto_eLpNorm_convolution_sub` does not apply to `a` itself. It applies
to the truncation `a · 1_B` on a large ball, and `convolution_congr_of_eqOn` says the truncation
changes the mollification nowhere near the test function once the kernel radius is below the
margin. That is `tendsto_setIntegral_mul_convolution_of_measurable`, which replaces the
`C¹`-weight dominated-convergence lemma and is applied three times, once per term.

## Main declarations

* `weakDerivOn_smul_test_contDiff`: the identity for a `C^∞` weight, with no mollification.
* `abs_setIntegral_mul_le`: Cauchy-Schwarz, with the second factor left as an `eLpNorm`.
* `tendsto_setIntegral_mul_convolution_of_measurable`: the mollification limit against an `L²`
  class, for a weight that is measurable and essentially bounded and nothing more.
* `HasWeakDerivOn.mul_isWkInfty_left`: the Leibniz rule for a `W^{1,∞}` weight.

`b` is smooth, then for every test function `φ` supported in `V`,

`∫_V g · (b · ∂_ℓφ) = - ∫_V (g' · b + g · ∂_ℓ b) · φ`.

No mollification and no product rule for weak derivatives is involved: `b · φ` is a smooth
compactly supported test function supported inside `V`, so `HasWeakDerivOn` applies to it
directly, and the classical Leibniz rule splits the derivative of the product. -/

/-! ### Mollification limit for a measurable weight -/

/-- **The mollification limit against an `L²` class.** For a measurable, essentially bounded `c`,
an `L²(V)` class `h` and a continuous compactly supported `η`,

`∫_V h · ((c ⋆ ρ_ε) · η) → ∫_V h · (c · η)`.

Continuity of `c` is not assumed, so `c ⋆ ρ_ε → c` pointwise is unavailable and the limit is
taken in `L²`. Cauchy-Schwarz leaves `‖(c ⋆ ρ_ε - c) · η‖_{L²}`, which sees `c` only on the
compact support of `η`. Replacing `c` there by its truncation to a large closed ball, which
`convolution_congr_of_eqOn` shows to change nothing once the kernel radius is under the margin,
puts the difference inside the reach of `tendsto_eLpNorm_convolution_sub`. -/

/-! ### Leibniz rule -/

/-- **Weak-derivative Leibniz with a `W^{1,∞}` weight.** If `g` has weak `ℓ`-derivative `g'` on
`V`, and `a` is measurable and essentially bounded with an essentially bounded weak `ℓ`-derivative
`a'`, then `a·g` has weak `ℓ`-derivative `a'·g + a·g'` on `V`.

This is `HasWeakDerivOn.mul_contDiff_left` with the `C¹` hypothesis on the weight removed, which
is what Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2
(p. 65) asks for. The weight is mollified, the smooth case
`weakDerivOn_smul_test_contDiff` gives the identity at every radius, and
`tendsto_setIntegral_mul_convolution_of_measurable` carries each of the three terms to its
limit. -/
