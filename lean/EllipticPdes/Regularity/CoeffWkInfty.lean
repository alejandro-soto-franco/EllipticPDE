# `W^{k,∞}` coefficients

Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2
(*Higher Interior Regularity*, p. 65) runs the induction over `a_{ij} ∈ W^{k+2,∞}(Ω)` and
`b_i, c ∈ W^{k+1,∞}(Ω)`, where Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1,
Theorem 2 asks for `C^{m+1}`. This file states Guo's hypothesis: weak derivatives up to
order `k`, each essentially bounded, with no continuity assumed anywhere.

## Choice of a new weak-derivative predicate

`HasWeakDerivOn` is typed on `Lp ℝ 2 (volume.restrict V)` classes, which suits a solution on a
bounded domain. A coefficient is a bounded measurable function on all of `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin
d)`, and on an unbounded domain such a function need not be `L²`, so it has no `Lp 2` class to
represent it. `HasWeakPartial` below is the same integration-by-parts identity stated for plain
functions, which is where a locally integrable coefficient lives.

## Indexing of the derivative family

The iterated derivative is indexed by a `List (Fin d)` of directions rather than by a
multi-index in `Fin d →₀ ℕ`. Guo's proof expands `D^α` through the Leibniz rule over
`β ≤ α`, and both indexings support that; a list is chosen because one step of the recursion
is `cons`, matching `D_step`, whereas a finitely-supported function would need the order of
differentiation to be quotiented out before the recursion could be stated. Equality of mixed
partials is a theorem about the family rather than part of its definition, so nothing here
presumes it.

The family is data, not an existential: `D α i j` names the chosen representative of the
order-`α.length` derivative of the `(i,j)` entry. `D_nil` pins the empty list to the
coefficient itself and `D_step` makes each successive entry a weak derivative of its parent.

## Main declarations

* `HasWeakPartial`: the weak partial derivative of a plain function.
* `IsWkInftyCoeff`: Guo's coefficient hypothesis at order `k`.
* `IsWkInftyCoeff.mono`: an order-`k` bundle is an order-`l` bundle for every `l ≤ k`.

## Statements this file does not yet supply

The bridge `IsCkCoeff A k → IsWkInftyCoeff A k` and the difference-quotient bound under the
weaker hypothesis. The latter cannot be had in the everywhere-pointwise form that
`IsC1Coeff.abs_diffQuot_coeff_le` currently has: that proof is the classical mean value
inequality, which needs a derivative at every point, and recovering a pointwise bound from an
essentially bounded weak derivative is the statement that `W^{1,∞}` functions have Lipschitz
representatives. Mathlib has Rademacher's theorem in the opposite direction
(`LipschitzWith.ae_differentiableAt`) and not this one. The route that avoids it is
mollification: `(∇a) * ρ_ε` inherits the essential bound of `∇a`, the classical inequality
applies to the smooth `a * ρ_ε`, and the bound passes to the limit almost everywhere. That
yields the bound a.e. rather than everywhere, which is all its consumers integrate against.
