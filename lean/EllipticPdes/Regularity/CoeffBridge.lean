# Classical `Cᵏ` coefficients satisfy Guo's `W^{k,∞}` hypothesis

`EllipticPdes.Regularity.IsCkCoeff` states the coefficient hypothesis of Evans, *Partial
Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 2: every entry is `Cᵏ` with a uniform bound
on each `iteratedFDeriv`. `EllipticPdes.Regularity.IsWkInftyCoeff` states the weaker hypothesis
of Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2
(p. 65): weak derivatives up to order `k`, essentially bounded. This file connects them, so
that a theorem proved under Guo's hypothesis applies to smooth coefficients with no further
work.

The bridge needs two facts and nothing else. A classical partial derivative of a `C¹` function
is a weak partial derivative, which is integration by parts against a compactly supported test
function. A classical iterated partial derivative is a value of `iteratedFDeriv` on unit
vectors, so the operator-norm bound of `IsCkCoeff` transfers to it pointwise, and a pointwise
bound is in particular an essential bound.

## Iterated classical partial derivative

`iterPartial f α` applies `partialD` once per entry of `α`, outermost first, so that
`iterPartial f (l :: α) = ∂_l (iterPartial f α)`. This is the `cons` convention of
`IsWkInftyCoeff.D`, which is what makes `iterPartial` a legal choice of `D`.

## Main declarations

* `iterPartial`: the iterated classical partial derivative along a list of directions.
* `iterPartial_eq_iteratedFDeriv`: it is `iteratedFDeriv` evaluated on the unit vectors of the
  list.
* `hasWeakPartial_partialD`: a classical partial derivative of a `C¹` function is a weak one.
* `IsCkCoeff.toIsWkInftyCoeff`: the bridge.

partial derivatives serve as the weak derivative family, each step is integration by parts,
and the pointwise `iteratedFDeriv` bound of `IsCkCoeff` is in particular an essential bound.

Guo, *Partial Differential Equations I and II* (Course Lecture Notes), Theorem VIII.3.2
(p. 65) is therefore no weaker than Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1,
Theorem 2 as far as the coefficients go, and a result proved under `IsWkInftyCoeff` applies
to smooth coefficients through this map. -/
