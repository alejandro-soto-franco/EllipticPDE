# The cutoff of a directional derivative lies in `H₀¹(Ω)`

Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 2 bootstraps interior
regularity by running the interior `H²` estimate on a derivative `∂_ℓ u` of the weak solution.
`EllipticPdes.Regularity.interior_H2_estimate` quantifies its solution over `H₀¹(Ω)`, and
`∂_ℓ u` carries no boundary condition, so the derivative has to be cut off before it can be fed
back in. This file supplies the resulting admissibility statement: for the middle cutoff `ξ` of
a cutoff tower, the product `ξ · ∂_ℓ u` is again an element of `H₀¹(Ω)`.

The route is a weak limit of the discrete family `cutoffMul ξ (diffQuotG ℓ h u)`, every member
of which lies in `H₀¹(Ω)` by `cutoffMul_diffQuotG_mem_H01`. The family is bounded in the graph
norm uniformly in the step: the function coordinate and the second Leibniz summand of each
gradient coordinate are controlled by the first-order bound `‖Dₖ^h u‖ ≤ ‖∂ₖu‖`, and the first
Leibniz summand `ξ · Dₖ^h ∂ᵢu` is exactly what the master energy estimate
`interior_diffQuot_energy_bound` controls. Weak sequential compactness then produces a limit,
which stays in `H₀¹(Ω)` because a closed subspace equals its double orthogonal complement, and
the function coordinate of the limit is pinned by the weak `L²` convergence of the difference
quotients.

## Main declarations

* `restrictL2_diffQuot_extendL2`: the interior difference quotient as the restriction of the
  whole-space one.
* `inner_mulTest_comm`: multiplication by a cutoff is self-adjoint on `L²(Ω)`.
* `exists_mem_H01_mulTest_gradient`: the cutoff of a directional derivative lies in `H₀¹(Ω)`.
* `interior_cutoffGrad_mem_H01`: the same, together with the weak gradient it carries.

/-! ### Restricted and whole-space difference quotients -/

/-- **The interior difference quotient is the restriction of the whole-space one.** Both sides
evaluate to `((extendL2 g)(x + h eₖ) - g x) / h` almost everywhere on `Ω`, because extension by
zero agrees with the class there. No support hypothesis is needed: the identity is read on `Ω`
only (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1). -/

difference quotient of the function coordinate is bounded by the corresponding gradient
coordinate, uniformly in the step: extension by zero carries the weak derivative
(`hasWeakDeriv_extendL2_of_mem_H01`), the whole-space bound `‖Dₖ^h g‖ ≤ ‖g'‖` applies, and
restriction is non-expansive (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §5.8.2). -/

/-- **A one-neighbourhood shift margin.** If the cutoff `η` is `≡ 1` on a neighbourhood of a
compact set `K`, then there is a positive margin `δ` such that `η` is locally constant `≡ 1`
near every point within `δ` of `K`. This restates, for use outside
`EllipticPdes.Regularity.Interior.NormBound`, the localisation fact that shifting a support
point of one tower cutoff by less than the margin lands where the next cutoff is identically
`1` (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1). -/

/-! ### The uniform graph-norm bound on the discrete family -/

/-- **Uniform graph-norm bound.** For a weak solution `u` and a cutoff tower `T`, the discrete
family `ξ · Dₗ^h u` is bounded in the ambient graph norm uniformly over all steps below a
positive margin. The function coordinate and the second Leibniz summand of each gradient
coordinate are handled by the first-order bound `‖Dₗ^h u‖ ≤ ‖∂ₗu‖`; the first Leibniz summand
`ξ · Dₗ^h ∂ᵢu` is the quantity the master energy estimate
`interior_diffQuot_energy_bound` controls, once the four step-smallness conditions of that
estimate are read off the tower margins (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.),
§6.3.1). -/

/-! ### The cutoff of a directional derivative lies in `H₀¹(Ω)` -/

/-- **The cutoff of a directional derivative is admissible (Evans, *Partial Differential
Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 2, step 3).** For a weak solution `u ∈ H₀¹(Ω)` of
`L u = f` with `C¹` principal coefficients and a cutoff tower `T` for `V ⋐ Ω`, the product
`ξ · ∂_ℓ u` of the middle tower cutoff with a directional derivative of `u` is again an element
of `H₀¹(Ω)`: there is `W ∈ H₀¹(Ω)` whose function coordinate is `ξ · ∂_ℓ u`. Since `H₀¹(Ω)`
sits inside the weak-gradient graph space, the gradient coordinates of `W` are then the weak
derivatives of `ξ · ∂_ℓ u`, which `hasWeakDeriv_extendL2_of_mem_H01` reads off.

This is the admissibility step the `H^k` bootstrap needs and that Evans does not: his interior
`H²` theorem asks only `u ∈ H¹(U)`, so he differentiates the equation without cutting off,
whereas `EllipticPdes.Regularity.interior_H2_estimate` quantifies its solution over `H₀¹(Ω)`
and `∂_ℓ u` carries no boundary condition.

The proof takes a weak limit of the admissible discrete family `ξ · Dₗ^h u`, whose members lie
in `H₀¹(Ω)` by `cutoffMul_diffQuotG_mem_H01` and which is bounded in the graph norm by
`exists_cutoffMul_diffQuotG_norm_bound`. The limit stays in `H₀¹(Ω)` because a closed subspace
of a Hilbert space equals its double orthogonal complement, and its function coordinate is
pinned by the weak `L²` convergence `Dₗ^h u ⇀ ∂_ℓ u`. -/

/-- **The cutoff derivative is an `H₀¹` function with its weak gradient (Evans, *Partial
Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, Theorem 2, step 3).** For a weak solution
`u ∈ H₀¹(Ω)` of `L u = f` with `C¹` principal coefficients and a cutoff tower `T` for
`V ⋐ Ω`, the product `ξ · ∂_ℓ u` of the middle tower cutoff with a directional derivative of
`u` is an element `W` of `H₀¹(Ω)`, and each gradient coordinate `W_{k+1}` of that element is
the weak `k`-derivative of `ξ · ∂_ℓ u` on the whole space.

This is the admissibility step that lets `EllipticPdes.Regularity.interior_H2_estimate`, whose
solution is quantified over `H₀¹(Ω)`, be applied to a derivative of `u`, which carries no
boundary condition of its own. Because `ξ ≡ 1` on `tsupport ζ`, and `ζ ≡ 1` on `V`, the
function coordinate agrees with `∂_ℓ u` on a neighbourhood of `V`, so nothing is lost on the
region of interest. -/

/-- **The cutoff is invisible on the base set.** Because `ξ ≡ 1` on `V`, the `V`-restriction of
the whole-space extension of `ξ · g` agrees with that of `g`. Applied to the function
coordinate of `interior_cutoffGrad_mem_H01`, this says that the admissible element carries
`∂_ℓ u` itself on `V`, so nothing is lost on the region of interest.

Kept as the statement that reads `interior_cutoffGrad_mem_H01`, which is pinned in `AxiomAudit`.
Nothing else consumes it. -/
