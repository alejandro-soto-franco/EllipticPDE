# The interior difference quotient on `L2D Ω` / `H1amb Ω`

The interior second-derivative estimate (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.),
§6.3.1; Gilbarg-Trudinger, *Elliptic PDE of Second Order*, Theorem 8.8) needs a difference
quotient that stays on the restricted-domain space `L2D Ω`. Rather than build a
self-contained restricted translation calculus (translation by `h eₖ` is not an
endomorphism of `L2D Ω`, since it maps into `Lp ℝ 2 (volume.restrict (Ω - h eₖ))`), this
file *conjugates the whole-space difference-quotient engine*
(`EllipticPdes.Regularity.diffQuot`) through the extension-by-zero bridge
`extendL2 : L2D Ω →ₗᵢ[ℝ] EucL2 d` and its retraction `restrictL2 : EucL2 d →L[ℝ] L2D Ω`:
extend by zero, translate on the whole space where `diffQuot` already lives, restrict back.

## Main definitions

* `restrictL2`: the retraction `EucL2 d →L[ℝ] L2D Ω`, adjoint to `extendL2`.
* `diffQuotD`: the interior difference quotient `Dₖʰ` on `L2D Ω`.
* `diffQuotG`: the graph-level interior difference quotient on `H1amb Ω`.

## Main results

* `extendL2_inner_restrictL2`: `restrictL2` is the adjoint of `extendL2`.
* `extendL2_diffQuotD_eq`: on classes whose translated support stays in `Ω`, the restricted
  difference quotient's extension equals the honest whole-space difference quotient.

/-- **Restriction** `EucL2 d →L[ℝ] L2D Ω`, `g ↦ g|_Ω`: the retraction and adjoint of
`extendL2`. Built from the Mathlib restriction of `Lp` classes to a restricted measure
(`MeasureTheory.LpToLpRestrictCLM`), non-expansive since `volume.restrict Ω ≤ volume`
(Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1). -/

/-- **The interior difference quotient** `Dₖʰ` on `L2D Ω`: extend by zero, translate on the
whole space, restrict back. A bounded operator for every `h` (no support hypothesis needed
for boundedness; the identity with the honest whole-space difference quotient needs a
support condition, see `extendL2_diffQuotD_eq`). Evans, *Partial Differential Equations*

applying `diffQuotD k h` in every ambient coordinate. Assembled exactly as `cutoffMul`
(`EllipticPdes.Regularity.cutoffMul`), by conjugating the coordinatewise pi-map with
`PiLp.continuousLinearEquiv`. Since `Dₖʰ` commutes with weak differentiation coordinatewise,
this is `(Dₖʰ u₀, Dₖʰ ∂₁u, …, Dₖʰ ∂ₙu)` on graphs (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations*
(2nd ed.), §6.3.1). -/

/-- **Whole-space compatibility.** On classes whose whole-space translate stays supported
in `Ω`, the interior difference quotient's extension by zero equals the honest whole-space
difference quotient of the extension: `extendL2 (Dₖʰ g) = Dₖʰ (extendL2 g)`. This lets the
whole-space adjoint relation `diffQuot_inner_adjoint` act on restricted-domain difference
quotients (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1, proof of Theorem 3). -/
