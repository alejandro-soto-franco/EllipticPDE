# `Cᵏ` coefficients, indexed by the derivative order

Higher interior regularity (Evans, *Partial Differential Equations* (2nd ed.), §6.3.1,
Theorem 2) runs by induction on `m`, and its hypothesis moves with the induction: reaching
`u ∈ H^{m+2}_loc` asks for `aᵢⱼ ∈ C^{m+1}`. A hypothesis whose derivative order is fixed by
the name of the structure cannot be the induction hypothesis of that argument, so
`IsC1Coeff` and `IsC2Coeff` each state one instance of a family and neither states the
family. This file gives the family.

`IsCkCoeff A k` bundles `ContDiff ℝ k` on every entry together with a uniform bound on each
iterated derivative of order `1 ≤ m ≤ k`. Orders start at one because order zero is already
carried by `EllipticCoeff.Λ`, so the mixin adds exactly the derivative data and nothing that
the bundle beneath it already supplies.

The bounds are collected as a single function `bound : ℕ → ℝ` rather than as one field per
order. A `Fin (k+1)`-indexed family would carry the order in its type and force a cast at
every use; the constraint `1 ≤ m ≤ k` in `iteratedFDeriv_bdd` says which values of the
function carry meaning, and `mono` then restricts to a lower order without touching it.

Derivatives are taken as `iteratedFDeriv`, where `IsC2Coeff` nests `fderiv` inside `fderiv`.
The two agree at order two (`norm_fderiv_fderiv_eq` below, from Mathlib's
`norm_iteratedFDeriv_fderiv` and `norm_iteratedFDeriv_one`), and only the iterated form has
a statement at a general order.

## Main declarations

* `IsCkCoeff`: the indexed mixin.
* `IsCkCoeff.mono`: an order-`k` bundle is an order-`l` bundle for every `l ≤ k`.
* `IsCkCoeff.toIsC1Coeff`, `IsC1Coeff.toIsCkCoeff`: the round trip at order one.
* `IsCkCoeff.toIsC2Coeff`, `IsC2Coeff.toIsCkCoeff`: the round trip at order two.

Both existing structures are left in place and unchanged, so every current consumer of
`IsC1Coeff` and `IsC2Coeff` is untouched, and a consumer written against the family can be
fed from either by the conversions above.
