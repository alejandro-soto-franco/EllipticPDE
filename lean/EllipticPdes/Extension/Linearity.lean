# Linearity of the chart extension

Evans states the extension as a bounded linear operator, where Guo's proof produces an
extension for each class. The three maps the chart extension runs on are all precomposition
or multiplication by a fixed function, so the extension is linear in the class once the chart
and its graph are fixed. This file records that.

Each statement is written with an explicit lambda on both sides rather than `Pi.add`, because
the shear and the reflection are applied to the function argument and a goal written with
`Pi.add` does not match one written with a lambda.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Extension.evenExt_add` and `evenExt_smul`: the even reflection is linear.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.evenExtGrad_add` and `evenExtGrad_smul`: so is its gradient.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.shearGrad_add` and `shearGrad_smul`: so is the shear's gradient.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.chartExt_add` and `chartExt_smul`: so is the chart extension.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.chartExtGrad_add` and `chartExtGrad_smul`: so is its gradient.
