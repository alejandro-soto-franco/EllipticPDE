# Cutting a class off inside a boundary chart

Guo's Theorem III.2.2 finishes by covering the boundary with finitely many chart
neighbourhoods and gluing the local extensions with a partition of unity. Each piece of that
partition is a cutoff supported in one chart's ball, and the piece it cuts out has to reach the
whole region above that chart's graph, where the chart describes the domain only inside the
ball.

That is what this file supplies. A cutoff supported in `W` sends a weak gradient on `B ∩ W` to
a weak gradient on all of `B`, since a test function on `B` multiplied by the cutoff is a test
function on `B ∩ W`, and every integrand the identity names vanishes off `W` along with the
cutoff. `hasWeakGradOn_univ_mul_cutoff` is the case `W ⊆ B`, where the conclusion reaches the
whole space; here the cutoff straddles the boundary of `B`, which is what a boundary chart
does.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Extension.integrableOn_of_vanishing_off`: integrability spreads from the part
  of a set inside a neighbourhood when the class vanishes outside it.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.hasWeakGradOn_mul_cutoff_inter`: the weak gradient of a class cut off
  inside a neighbourhood, on the surrounding set.

/-- **Weak gradient of a class cut off inside a neighbourhood.** If `u` has weak gradient `g` on
`B ∩ W` and `η` is smooth with `tsupport η ⊆ W`, then `η u` has weak gradient
`η gₖ + u ∂ₖη` on all of `B`. Testing against `φ` reduces to testing the hypothesis against
`η φ`, whose support sits inside `B ∩ W`, and both sides of the identity see only `W`, the
cutoff and its derivative vanishing off it. -/
