# Local boundary extension

Guo's Theorem III.2.2 reaches its third step with a local extension for each chart: a class on
the chart's neighbourhood agreeing with the original on the part of the domain that
neighbourhood meets. This file proves that statement, which is the whole content of his step 2
once the chart is in hand.

The proof composes what the chapter has built. A cutoff between two balls makes the class reach
the whole region above the chart's graph, the rigid motion of the chart takes it into the
coordinates the graph is written in, the reflection extends it across the graph, and the motion
takes the result back. Guo's step 2 works with a function smooth up to the boundary and reads
the chain rule off it; here every step is a weak gradient.

Two points where the statement is narrower than the machinery. The chart asks nothing of the
gradient of its graph, as Evans' definition does not, so the proof runs on the bounded graph
`exists_bounded_graph` supplies, whose region agrees with the chart's on exactly the ball in
play. The conclusion is on a ball strictly inside the chart's, which is where the cutoff is one,
and is what a partition of unity subordinate to the cover asks for anyway.

## Constant before the class

Clause (iii) of the theorem asks for a constant quantified before the class, and the chain the
construction runs through re-chooses data at three places: the bounded graph of
`exists_bounded_graph`, the cutoff between the two balls, and the bound each supplies. All three
depend on the chart and the two radii alone, so `exists_localExtension_bound` fixes them first
and lets the class come after. The bound then threads the five estimates the chain has: the
cutoff's supremum, the rigid motion, the reflection, the shear, and the sum over the coordinates
the motion mixes.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Extension.exists_localExtension_bound`: the local boundary extension with a
  constant fixed before the class.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.exists_localExtension`: the same with the constant discarded.

/-- **Seminorm of a coordinate combination.** A combination of finitely many classes whose
coefficients are at most one in absolute value has seminorm at most the sum of theirs. This is
what the rigid motion of a chart contributes, the coordinates of the image of a unit direction
being at most one. -/

`S ∩ W` the class is read on `T`, so the product over `S` is bounded by the supremum of the
cutoff against the seminorm over `T`. This is what lets an estimate taken over the region above
a chart's graph be stated against the domain. -/

coordinates, cut off there, extended across the flattened boundary, and returned. Every step
but the class itself is fixed by the chart, its graph `γ` and the cutoff `ξ`, so the whole is
linear in the class. -/

product rule, the chart's rigid motion mixes the coordinates on the way in and on the way
out, and the shear and the reflection supply the rest. -/

/-- The bounded graph the chart's extension runs on. A chart's own graph need not have a
bounded gradient, which every statement about the shear asks for, and `exists_bounded_graph`
supplies one agreeing with it on the chart's ball. The choice is made from the chart alone,
before any class appears, which is what keeps the extension linear. -/

/-- **Guo's local boundary extension with its constant** (Theorem III.2.2, proof step 2, p. 21).
Near a boundary point the class extends across the boundary: on any ball strictly inside the
chart's, `localExt` has a weak gradient there and agrees with the original on the part of the
domain the ball meets, and both it and its gradient are bounded in every `Lᵖ` seminorm by the
class and its gradient over the domain, with one constant taken before the class.

The extension is named rather than existentially quantified, which is what lets the operator
be assembled as a linear map. -/
