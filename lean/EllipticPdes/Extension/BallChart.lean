# `C¹` boundary of the unit ball

Every theorem of this development on a bounded domain with `C¹` boundary has, until this file,
only the half space as an instance of its boundary hypothesis, and the half space is
unbounded. This file supplies the unit ball, so that the extension operator, the embeddings of
order `k`, global approximation, Rellich-Kondrachov on `H¹(Ω)` and the Poincaré inequality
with the mean subtracted all have a domain to be applied to.

The chart at a boundary point is the reflection in the hyperplane bisecting the point and the
south pole, which is a linear isometry sending the point to the pole and the ball to itself,
together with the graph of the lower hemisphere, cut off in the tangential directions so that
it is `C¹` on the whole space and independent of the vertical coordinate. On the ball of radius
one half about the pole every point has vertical coordinate below one half and tangential part
of norm below one half, so the cutoff is inactive, and the ball is the region above the graph
there because `‖y‖² = ‖y'‖² + y_d²` with `y_d < 0`.

## Main declarations

* `EllipticPdes.Extension.norm_sq_eq_tangential_add_sq`: the norm splits into the tangential
  part and the coordinate.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.ballGraph`: the cut-off lower hemisphere.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.ballChart`: the chart at a boundary point of the unit ball.
* `EllipticPdes.Extension.hasC1Boundary_ball`: the unit ball has `C¹` boundary.
