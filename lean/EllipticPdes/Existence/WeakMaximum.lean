# Weak maximum principle

A weak subsolution of a transport-free divergence-form equation with nonnegative zeroth-order
coefficient is bounded above by its boundary values. The boundary inequality `u ≤ k on ∂Ω`
for a Sobolev class is read, following Gilbarg and Trudinger, as membership of `(u - k)⁺` in
`H₀¹(Ω)`, and the conclusion is `u ≤ k` almost everywhere for every `k ≥ 0` with that
property, which is the inequality `sup_Ω u ≤ sup_∂Ω u⁺` between the essential supremum and
the infimum of such `k`.

The proof is the transport-free case the source singles out. Testing the subsolution
inequality against `v = (u - k)⁺`, the zeroth-order term is nonnegative because `u v ≥ 0`, so
the principal term is nonpositive. The weak gradient of `v` is the gradient of `u` where
`u > k` and zero elsewhere, so the principal term is the energy of `v` itself, which
ellipticity bounds below by the gradient norm. The gradient of `v` therefore vanishes, and the
Poincaré inequality on `H₀¹` of a bounded domain makes `v` vanish.

The subsolution inequality is taken against every nonnegative element of `H₀¹(Ω)`, which is
the form the source uses in the proof, having extended the inequality from `C¹` test functions
by density.

/-- **Weak maximum principle** (Gilbarg and Trudinger Theorem 8.1, in the transport-free
case). Let `Ω` be a bounded open set, `L` a divergence-form operator with no transport term and
nonnegative zeroth-order coefficient, and `U ∈ H¹(Ω)` a weak subsolution, meaning the bilinear
pairing of `U` against every nonnegative `V ∈ H₀¹(Ω)` is nonpositive. If `k ≥ 0` and
`(u - k)⁺` is the function coordinate of some element of `H₀¹(Ω)`, then `u ≤ k` almost
everywhere on `Ω`. -/
